Named for the civil rights icon John Lewis, the bill is narrower than the Democrats' sweeping elections overhaul that has stalled in the Senate, but faces similar obstacles.
The House voted on Tuesday to restore federal oversight of state election laws under the 1965 Voting Rights Act and expand its reach, as Democrats moved to strengthen a crowning legislative achievement of the civil rights era amid a renewed national fight over access to the ballot box. 
  The legislation, named after Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon who died last year, is a linchpin of the party's strategy to combat voting restrictions in Republican-led states. It would reverse two Supreme Court rulings that gutted the statute, reviving the power of the Justice Department to bar some discriminatory election changes from taking effect and easing the path to challenge others in court.
  Up against urgent deadlines before next year's midterm elections, Democrats voted along party lines to adopt the bill 219 to 212 in a rare August session, just days after it was introduced. But stiff Republican opposition awaits in the Senate, where a likely filibuster threatens to sink it before it can reach President Biden's desk.
  That outcome is becoming familiar this summer, as Democrats on Capitol Hill try to use their party's control of Congress and the White House to lock in watershed election changes -- only to be blocked by their Republican counterparts. In the meantime, more than a dozen G.O.P.-led states have already enacted more than 30 laws this year making it harder to vote.
  Frustration with that dynamic has fueled increasingly desperate calls from progressives and many mainstream Democrats to invoke the so-called nuclear option and eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Doing so would allow Democrats to move unilaterally without Republican support, but any rules change would require support from all 50 Democrats in the chamber, and key moderates are opposed.
  Brimming with urgency and symbolism, the debate leading up to Tuesday's vote only served to deepen a divide between the parties over voting issues that has rapidly widened in the past year.
  Democrat after Democrat showed images of Mr. Lewis and warned that the victories for Black voting rights he won after being beaten bloody on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma half a century earlier were once again on the line. They pointed to new rules in Georgia, Ohio, Florida and elsewhere making it harder to vote by mail, to vote early or to register to vote close to Election Day, which they said disproportionately affected voters of color and young people.
  ''Old battles have indeed become new again,'' said Representative Terri A. Sewell, the Alabama Democrat who represents Selma and wrote the bill in Mr. Lewis's name. ''While literacy tests and poll taxes no longer exist, certain states and local jurisdictions have passed laws that are modern-day barriers to voting.''
  Proponents of the bill framed it as a vital complement to Democrats' other major elections bill, the For the People Act, to halt and reverse that retrenchment, which has stalled in the Senate amid a Republican filibuster. Even more ambitious, that legislation would set new national standards making it easier to vote, end partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money.
  Republicans, who once enthusiastically supported expansions of the Voting Rights Act, dismissed that concern as hyperbolic and self-serving. Democrats, they argued, were ignoring the nation's racial progress as justification to allow the federal government to run roughshod over the states and rewrite election rules in a way that would benefit their political candidates.
  ''Not only is our country not facing a new era of Jim Crow voting laws, as many of my Democrat colleagues have claimed, it is incredibly offensive to lie to the American people to advance a political agenda,'' said Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois.
  He cited statistics showing record turnout among Black voters during the 2020 election, a far cry from the small percentages that were able to vote in many Southern states the 1960s.
  ''We should celebrate this progress, not ignore it,'' Mr. Davis said.
  Much of the present conflict can be traced to 2013, when a conservative majority of the Supreme Court effectively struck down a crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. The provision required states and jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices -- mostly in the South -- to clear any changes to their election rules with the federal government before carrying them out.
  It had been highly effective, blocking more than 3,000 proposed electoral changes found to be discriminatory during the half century it was in effect and contributing to the statute's reputation as one of the clearest legislative successes of the civil rights movement. But the justices ruled that the formula used to determine which entities should be subject to such requirements was outdated given the country's progress, and said Congress would have to update it for it to be constitutional.
  In the absence of any so-called federal pre-clearance requirement, more than half of states have enacted laws making it harder to vote over the last eight years. Voting advocates have been just as concerned that in its absence, state lawmakers will be able to use the once-in-a-decade redistricting process that is underway to marginalize voters of color.
  Then, last month, the Supreme Court in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee took aim at a separate section of the statute and made it harder to win court challenges against election rules on the grounds that they are discriminatory.
  Lawmakers drafted the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to reverse both rulings and spent months collecting a careful legislative record in anticipation that any changes that became law would be scrutinized by the justices.
  At its core is a new formula for determining which states and local entities should be subject to pre-clearance by looking at voting rights violations over the last 25 years. At least one analysis suggests eight states -- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas -- and a handful of counties would be subject to such oversight.
  But it would also require most jurisdictions in the country -- not just those with a history of discrimination -- to get federal approval before adopting certain sensitive electoral changes, like stringent new voter identification requirements, removing polling places, completing the lines of electoral districts or putting in place new policies to cull voter rolls en masse.
  Other provisions tucked in the bill could have a meaningful impact on voting disputes. For example, the legislation would lower the bar for plaintiffs suing to stop elections changes under the Voting Rights Act to win preliminary injunctions to keep them from taking effect until a court can review them. Currently, elections changes that are later struck down can often take effect for months or even years because the lawsuits take so long to resolve.
  Elsewhere, the legislation appears to take direct aim at many of the Republican state officials who have used unsubstantiated and often vague concerns about voter fraud -- particularly the false claims promulgated by former President Donald J. Trump -- to justify locking in new restrictions on mail-in ballots and the use of drop boxes, or to cut back on early voting. Merely invoking concerns of ''voter fraud'' is not enough, the bill says, implying that states would have to provide evidence to back up their claims.
  Senators are still negotiating their own version of the legislation and have yet to settle on a date to reintroduce it or call a vote. Unlike the For the People Act, it is likely to attract some bipartisan support -- but not nearly enough to pass it.
  Only one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, has been willing to attach her name to similar bills in recent years. A spokeswoman for Ms. Murkowski declined to comment on the House version of the bill, but the senator told The New York Times earlier this year that she did not believe she could find nine other Republicans to join her in breaking the filibuster to pass the bill.

For Voting Protections, It May Be Democrats vs. the Roberts Court

The House's voting rights legislation named for the civil rights leader John Lewis seeks to counter the Supreme Court's longstanding bid to undermine the Voting Rights Act.
When Judge John G. Roberts Jr. faced the Senate for his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in September 2005, critics sounded the alarm about his longstanding skepticism toward the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which many view as crucial to the political gains of Black Americans over the last half century. 
  ''I fear that if Judge Roberts is confirmed to be chief justice of the United States, the Supreme Court would no longer hear the people's cries for justice,'' Representative John Lewis, the civil rights leader from Georgia, said in urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject the nomination. 
  Judge Roberts was easily confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate despite pleas from Mr. Lewis and other civil rights activists. He went on to oversee the court in rulings that weakened the Voting Right Acts, compromising its decades-long role as a protector of minority access to the ballot box across much of the South. Mr. Lewis died last July, just months before Republican state legislatures enacted an onslaught of voting restrictions after the 2020 elections.
  But it is not only those legislatures that Democrats see as their adversaries on election issues.
  ''We are also up against a Supreme Court that is keen on destroying our nation's most consequential voting rights law,'' Representative Terry A. Sewell, Democrat of Alabama, said this week during a Democratic call celebrating the anniversary of women's right to vote.
  While Mr. Lewis may be gone, House Democrats hope to keep his spirit alive by passing a bill bearing his name next week that they hope will offset what Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called ''disastrous'' and ''shameful'' decisions undermining voting rights by the Roberts-led court.
  The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act is one element of a two-pronged legislative effort by Democrats to protect minority voting rights. A much broader bill, the For the People Act, would impose an array of requirements on states to expand voting by mail and early voting along with extensive provisions on ethics, campaign finance and redistricting.
  The bill named for Mr. Lewis is narrower and focuses on restoring the power of the Voting Rights Act. Both measures face a bleak future in the Senate, where Republicans are nearly unanimous in their opposition to them.
  But Democrats, who control the evenly divided chamber with Vice President Kamala Harris's tiebreaking vote, say they have not given up.
  ''Republicans refusing to support anything on voting rights is not an excuse for Democrats to do nothing,'' said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, promising that Democrats would make the legislation a priority when they return after Labor Day.
  Democrats are scaling back the broader bill to unite their party for coming votes. The Lewis measure already has the backing of all 50 senators who caucus with Democratic leadership, including Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the sole Democrat who did not endorse the For the People Act. He has also enlisted the support of a lone Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, far from the minimum of 10 Republicans needed to overcome a filibuster.
  The Lewis measure is aimed at reinvigorating the voting protections Democrats say were lost in two Supreme Court decisions that ''gutted'' the landmark underlying law -- Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee. The first, with a majority opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts in 2013, rendered moot a requirement that state and local governments with a history of imposing discriminatory voting laws receive ''preclearance'' from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before making changes to how people voted. The second, with a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. last month, made it harder for minority voters to prove they were being discriminated against by asserting that the relevant part of the Voting Rights Act could be used only to strike down substantial voting restrictions, not merely inconvenient ones.
  The new, highly detailed legislation would establish a contemporary formula for determining when governments must obtain preclearance for new voting rules and also abolish the standard set by Justice Alito's opinion, which Democrats deplored as legislating from the bench. The bill would also require states to provide evidence of the voter fraud that the new laws are ostensibly meant to curtail.
  Democratic officials involved in drafting the John Lewis act say it was carefully written to withstand constitutional scrutiny from the six conservatives on the court. But given the record of the court, and particularly that of the chief justice, satisfying the justices could prove difficult even if Democrats were to somehow get the measure to President Biden's desk.
  As a young lawyer in the Reagan administration in 1982, Mr. Roberts aggressively fought a bipartisan proposal to revise the expiring Voting Rights Act to counter an adverse Supreme Court ruling on the law in Mobile v. Bolden. In that decision two years earlier, the court weakened the law by requiring proof that the intent of a voting restriction was to discriminate -- an exceedingly high bar. Democrats, with significant Republican support in Congress, proposed altering that new standard to one that required showing only that the result of a law was discriminatory.
  In a series of memos that later became public, Mr. Roberts, then a special assistant to the attorney general, argued vehemently against the change. In one noteworthy memo, he said that violations of the Voting Rights Act ''should not be made too easy to prove, since they provide a basis for the most intrusive interference imaginable by federal courts into state and local processes.'' Congressional Republicans, fearing they would be branded as racists should they oppose the change, rejected that view. A compromise measure was approved on a strong bipartisan vote after breaking a Senate filibuster led by Jesse Helms, the archconservative from North Carolina.
  At Judge Roberts's confirmation hearing in 2005, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, pressed him on what Mr. Kennedy characterized as his ''narrow and cramped, and perhaps even a meanspirited view of the law'' given his comments in 1982. But Judge Roberts said he was merely arguing the position of the Reagan administration and his boss.
  ''I was a staff lawyer in the Justice Department,'' he told Mr. Kennedy. ''It was the position of the Reagan administration for whom I worked, the position of the attorney general for whom I worked, that the Voting Rights Act should be extended for the longest period of its extension in history without change.''
  Eight years later, the chief justice wrote the opinion dismantling significant elements of the Voting Rights Act, saying that ''things have changed dramatically'' since the law's adoption in 1965 and that governments should no longer be subjected to preclearance.
  ''The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years,'' he said.
  Critics of that ruling and the subsequent one issued last month argue that the host of measures various states have passed in recent months make clear that Republicans have found new ''tests and devices'' to restrict access to the ballot. Those include provisions that make it harder to vote early or by mail, banning or restricting drop boxes, shortening early or absentee voting periods and giving more leeway to partisan poll watchers.
  In his 2005 testimony, Mr. Lewis, who was badly beaten in a civil rights march in Selma, Ala., in 1965, suggested that the nominee did not grasp what it had cost to enact the voting measure in the first place.
  ''In 1965, Jurist Roberts was 10 years old,'' Mr. Lewis testified. ''He may be a brilliant lawyer, but I wonder whether he can really understand the depth of what it took to get the Voting Rights Act passed.''
  ''As many of you know, I gave a little blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge,'' he told the senators, referring to the site of the march in Selma. ''But some of my friends and colleagues gave all they had, their very lives for the right to vote.''

Named for civil rights icon John Lewis, the bill is narrower than the Democrats’ sweeping elections overhaul that has stalled in the Senate, but faces similar obstacles.
The House voted on Tuesday to restore federal oversight of state election laws, beginning a push by Democrats to strengthen the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 amid a national fight over access to the ballot box.
The legislation, named after the late civil rights icon Representative John Lewis of Georgia, is a linchpin in Democrats’ strategy to combat voting restrictions in Republican-led states. It would reverse two Supreme Court rulings that gutted the statute, reviving the power of the Justice Department to bar some discriminatory election changes from taking effect and easing the path to challenging others in court.
Up against urgent deadlines ahead of next year’s midterm elections, Democrats adopted the measure 219 to 212 along party lines during a rare August session, just days after the bill was introduced. But stiff Republican opposition awaits in the Senate, where a likely filibuster threatens to sink the bill before it can reach President Biden’s desk.
That outcome is becoming familiar this summer, as Democrats on Capitol Hill try to use their party’s control of Congress and the White House to lock in watershed election changes — only to be blocked by their Republican counterparts. In the meantime, more than a dozen G.O.P.-led states have already enacted more than 30 laws making it harder to cast votes.
Frustration with that dynamic has fueled increasingly desperate calls from progressives and many mainstream Democrats to invoke the so-called nuclear option and eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Doing so would allow Democrats to move unilaterally without Republican support, but any rules change would require support from all 50 Democrats in the chamber, and key moderates oppose doing so.
During the debate before Tuesday’s vote, proponents of the bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, framed it as a vital complement to Democrats’ other major elections bill, the For the People Act. Even more ambitious, that legislation would set new national standards making it easier to vote, end partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money.
“Old battles have indeed become new again,” said Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama, the Democrat who represents Selma and wrote the bill. “While literacy tests and poll taxes no longer exist, certain states and local jurisdictions have passed laws that are modern-day barriers to voting.”
Lawmakers drafted the Voting Rights Act fix to respond directly to a pair of Supreme Court rulings in which a conservative majority invalidated or weakened key portions of the statute.
The first came in 2013, when the justices in the case of Shelby County v. Holder effectively struck down a provision requiring states and jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to receive advance approval from the federal government for any changes to their election rules.
The court specifically ruled that the formula used to determine which entities should be subject to such requirements was outdated, and said Congress would have to update it for it to be constitutional. The bill being debated on Tuesday proposes an updated and expanded coverage plan. 
The legislation also attempts to overturn a Supreme Court decision last month in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee that took aim at a separate section of the statute and made it harder to successfully challenge voting changes as discriminatory in court.
Republicans enthusiastically supported expansions of the Voting Rights Act in the past.

As Congress Recesses, The Clock Is Still Ticking For Voting Rights Bills

Democratic leaders vow to make voting legislation the ''first matter of legislative business'' in September. But their path remains cluttered with obstacles.
WASHINGTON -- With deadlines looming ahead of next year's midterm elections, the Senate adjourned on Wednesday for a monthlong recess with only the slimmest of paths left for passing federal voting rights legislation that Democrats hope can stop a wave of Republican state laws clamping down on ballot access. 
  Before dawn on Wednesday, Senate Republicans blocked last-minute attempts to debate a trio of elections bills, but Democratic leaders vowed that more votes would be the ''first matter of legislative business'' when they return in mid-September. First up is likely to be a scaled-back version of the party's far-reaching Senate Bill 1, the For the People Act, or S. 1, that Democrats believe will unite all 50 senators who caucus with them.
  ''Let there be no mistake about what is going on here,'' Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said just after 4 a.m. ''We have reached a point in this chamber where Republicans appear to oppose any measure -- no matter how common sense -- to protect voting rights and strengthen our democracy.''
  But such outrage did little to clarify how the party plans to get around a wall of Republican opposition in the Senate that has blocked progress since June. Nor did it quiet some of the outspoken and well-financed activists demanding that President Biden and his congressional majorities do everything possible -- including scrapping the Senate's planned vacation and its legislative filibuster rule -- to get the job done.
  Pressed by reporters later on Wednesday to outline how exactly Democrats would reverse their fortunes, Mr. Schumer said he was making progress by ''showing very clearly to every one of our 50 senators that Republicans won't join us.''
  ''As I've said before, everything is on the table,'' Mr. Schumer said.
  Advocates of voting rights legislation believe fleshing out Republicans' opposition will help build a rationale for centrist Democratic senators like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to reverse course and support either changing the entire filibuster rule or creating an exemption for elections-related changes to pass with a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.
  ''Biden and Senate Democrats need to tell us what their plan to pass S. 1 is,'' said Nita Chaudhary, the head of programming at the liberal advocacy group MoveOn, ''before it's too late.''
  The Census Bureau was expected on Thursday to share detailed demographic data with states, kicking off the final stages of the once-in-a-decade process of redrawing congressional districts. Under the current rules, Republicans plan to press their advantages in control of state redistricting processes to draw new maps that tilt the national playing field toward their own candidates, making it easier to retake control of the House next year.
  The For the People Act, which passed the House this spring, would end partisan gerrymandering by both parties by forcing states to use independent commissions to draw district boundaries. The bill would also mandate that states set up automatic voter registration, 15 days of early voting and no-excuse mail-in voting. It would require political groups to disclose the identity of their big donors.
  But Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, said Democrats could soon lose their window of opportunity to change the course of the redistricting process and the 2022 election. In time, it could similarly become difficult to stop the effects of new voting laws in more than a dozen Republican states that experts say will make it harder for young people and people of color to vote.
  ''If something passes after states have gone through those processes and the election is underway, it would be much less likely that any congressional requirement could go into effect before the 2024 elections,'' Mr. Hasen said of the redistricting process.
  Still, Democratic leaders insist they are making progress and can pass elections legislation even as they try to sew up two vast infrastructure and social program bills in the fall.
  Mr. Manchin, the only Democratic senator who does not support the original For the People Act, appears to be on the cusp of endorsing a somewhat narrower alternative that he has spent weeks negotiating with fellow Democrats. The new bill is likely to maintain many of the pillars of the original legislation, but include for the first time a national voter identification requirement and lop off new ethics requirements and a public campaign financing program for senators.
  Mr. Manchin said this week that he was still trying to win Republican votes for the plan, an unlikely outcome. But his colleagues have another motivation: They believe that Mr. Manchin will be more determined to fight for -- and potentially change Senate rules for -- a bill he helped write and watched Republicans tank.
  ''This is an iterative process,'' said Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat pushing party leaders not to let the issue lapse. He acknowledged they were up against a ''tight deadline.''
  The votes early Wednesday morning appeared to be intended to make precisely that point. After hours of debate over Democrats' separate $3.5 trillion budget blueprint, Mr. Schumer tried to force debates and votes on the original For the People Act, and on narrower bills focused on redistricting and campaign finance disclosure using unanimous consent to waive the normal Senate procedures.
  Republicans blocked all three, which they said constituted an attempt by Democrats to usurp the states and rewrite election rules for their benefit.
  ''This isn't going to work,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''It isn't going to work tonight, and it isn't going to work when we get back.''
  Republicans have threatened to grind the Senate to a halt if Democrats ax the filibuster rule. Mr. McConnell also suggested that his vote on Tuesday for Mr. Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure package was in part to show Ms. Sinema and Mr. Manchin -- two of its lead architects -- that the Senate could still function in a bipartisan way.
  So far, it has worked.
  Ms. Sinema told ABC's ''The View'' last week that a rules change could backfire and allow Republicans to pass a nationwide ban on mail-in voting when they next control Congress. And in an interview this month, Mr. Manchin appeared to rule out any filibuster exemptions.
  But Democrats still believe the new state voting laws and Republican efforts to rack up new safely red House seats in the weeks ahead may help move the senators.
  ''They are going to try to use the redistricting process to draw themselves into the majority, not only in the House of Representatives but the state legislatures,'' said Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
  Mr. Holder said that as long as Congress passed legislation outlawing the practice by the fall, Democrats could probably use the courts to stop the new maps. If not, he suggested Republicans might be correct when they spoke of locking in ''a decade of power.''
  ''That's what's at stake,'' he said.

The House plans to vote on it next week, but Republicans promise to block it in the Senate.
Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a long-awaited linchpin of their drive to protect voting rights, introducing legislation that would make it easier for the federal government to block state election rules found to be discriminatory to nonwhite voters.
House leaders expect to pass the bill, named the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act after the late civil rights icon, during a rare August session next week. They say it would restore the full force of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 after a pair of adverse Supreme Court rulings and that it would help combat a wave of restrictive new election laws in Republican-led states.
“Today, old battles have become new again as we face the most pernicious assault on the right to vote in generations,” said Representative Terri Sewell, the bill’s chief author and a Democrat from Alabama’s civil rights belt, where Mr. Lewis and others staged a national campaign for voting rights in the 1960s. “It’s clear: federal oversight is urgently needed.”
But like other voting rights legislation to come before Congress this year, its chances of passing the evenly divided Senate are exceedingly narrow. Only one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, is likely to support the legislation, leaving Democrats far short of the 60 votes they would need to break a Republican filibuster and send the bill to President Biden’s desk.
Senate Republicans already blocked Democrats’ other marquee voting rights bill, the For the People Act, which would establish national mandates for early and mail-in voting and end gerrymandering of congressional districts. And while Democratic leaders in the Senate have vowed more votes on the matter in September, unless all 50 Democrats unite in a long-shot bid to change Senate filibuster rules, they are headed for an identical outcome.
The legislation introduced by Ms. Sewell on Tuesday is an effort to restore key pieces of the landmark 1965 voting bill struck down or weakened by the Supreme Court over the last decade. Doing so, its proponents say, would make it far harder for states to restrict voting access in the future.
The most consequential ruling dates to 2013, when the justices effectively invalidated a section of the law that required states and localities with a history of discriminatory voting rules to clear any changes to their elections policies with the federal government. At the time, the justices said that the formula used to determine which states were subject to clearance was out of date and invited Congress to update it.
The bill also attempts to respond to a decision just last month in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee that effectively made it more difficult to challenge state voting laws as discriminatory in court using a different provision of the law.
Voting rights activists fear the two decisions will make it far easier for those in power to marginalize voters of color at the ballot box and during the once-in-a-decade redistricting process underway this year. Just this year, more than a dozen Republican-led states have enacted restrictive new voting laws.
“We have seen an upsurge in changes to voting laws that make it more difficult for minority citizens to vote and that is even before we confront a round of decennial redistricting where jurisdictions may draw new maps that have the purpose or effect of diluting or retrogressing minority voting strength,” Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, told a House panel on Monday.
Republicans joined Democrats in large numbers to reauthorize the full Voting Rights Act as recently as 2006. But since the high court’s 2013 decision, they have shown little interest in updating the statute, arguing that discrimination is largely a thing of the past and that the federal government ought to stay out of states’ rights to set their own election rules.
Asked about the bill on Tuesday, Russell Dye, a spokesman for Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, accused Democrats of ignoring “real problems” like the crisis of Afghanistan, the influx of migrants at the southern border and rising crime “in favor of pushing a radical far-left political agenda.”

Limited in their options and in disagreement about how far to go to pass federal legislation, Democrats are approaching voting rights as an issue to be won in future elections.
The For the People Act, the Democratic voting rights bill that President Biden urged Congress to pass in a major speech in Philadelphia this afternoon, was first introduced in January 2019. It was a simpler time: Few people outside Georgia had heard of Brad Raffensperger, Jan. 6 was just another date on the calendar, and the notion that large numbers of Republicans would join Donald J. Trump in baselessly denying his election loss seemed unlikely.
“Some things in America should be simple and straightforward,” Mr. Biden said in the speech, calling the bill “a national imperative.” He added, “Perhaps the most important of those things, the most fundamental of those things, is the right to vote: the right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly and the right to have your vote counted.”
The bill, also known as H.R. 1 or S. 1 (the names are symbolic of its priority for Democrats), addresses concerns that were top of mind for Democrats before the 2020 election, such as banning partisan gerrymandering, making voting easier and enforcing greater transparency on many political donations. Mr. Biden also called for passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would reinstate elements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the Supreme Court struck down in 2013.
However, even many commentators who have expressed concerns about the integrity of future elections have criticized the push for the For the People Act as fighting the last war. (Most Republicans have dismissed the bill as a partisan wish list.) These critics, who include The Times’s Nate Cohn, argue that the bill does little to defang the graver threat that elections might be overturned by partisan lawmakers, a possibility that state-level Republicans have pushed toward reality in electorally critical states like Georgia and Arizona.
“There are really two different issues going on,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, who supports parts of the For the People Act. “One is the commonly understood concern about voting suppression. The other, which is really new on the horizon since the 2020 election, is this danger of election subversion: The idea that election officials can manipulate election outcomes so that the winner of the election is not actually declared the winner.”
For Democrats, the For the People Act has the additional drawback of being virtually certain not to pass anytime soon. Progressive activists had hoped the bill’s high-minded commitments might be the thing that persuaded moderate Democratic senators like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to eliminate the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote supermajority for many bills to pass the Senate. Getting rid of that hurdle, the thinking went, would then enable Democrats to pass the law with their 50 votes in the Senate (and with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie).
Instead, Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema have vowed to retain the filibuster. On top of that, the bill doesn’t even have 50 votes: Mr. Manchin opposes it, and has instead offered his own compromise, which Republicans have dismissed.
Yet even amid the Covid-19 vaccination drive, a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a second huge budget bill, Democrats have continued to keep voting rights at the center of their messaging, most recently in the speech today.
One reason, Dr. Hasen pointed out, is that even if this appears to be an inopportune moment for Democrats, it is still better than any other foreseeable time. After all, Democrats hold the presidency, the Senate and the House. The 2022 midterm elections could well do away with that, as the Democrats’ control of Congress is extremely slight and presidents’ parties nearly always sustain a backlash in midterm elections. Dramatic developments, such as Texas Democratic lawmakers’ fleeing the state on Monday night to prevent the passage of a major bill that would restrict voting, underscore that sense of urgency.
Mr. Biden’s speech was meant partly as a message to civil rights activists that he hears and appreciates their concerns. Over the weekend, James E. Clyburn, the powerful Democratic congressman from South Carolina whose endorsement last year was critical to Mr. Biden’s securing the presidential nomination, called on the president to support removing the filibuster for legislation tied to electoral reforms. 
But another reason for Mr. Biden’s big push is the compelling nature of the issue itself. Mr. Biden called for a nonpartisan, nonpolitical response to what he characterized as Republican voter suppression efforts. He summoned past moments that most Americans accept as welcome elements of progress, including the country’s founding, Reconstruction, the women’s rights movement and the civil rights movement.
“This isn’t about Democrats or Republicans,” he said. “It’s literally about who we are as Americans.”
Mr. Biden used forceful rhetoric — he asked opponents of expanding voting rights if they had no shame — but he did not propose the structural reform that supporters of the For the People Act say is essential. But if Mr. Biden persuades voters, then at the margins it may improve the atmosphere for Democrats in states where Republicans control part or all of government — like Georgia and Arizona, and also Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Hampshire, where Senate races in 2022 (and presidential ones in 2024) are expected to be close.
It may also prove to be smart politics. The elements of the For the People Act are popular, according to a Data for Progress poll.
“Voting has become like climate change or immigration or abortion: a topic within the election itself,” Dr. Hasen said. “It’s something that Democrats and Republicans can’t ignore.”
Which is to say, it is another issue on which Democrats can run. Whether you consider the For the People Act a cynical attempt to help Democrats or an enlightened amelioration of American democracy (which might help Democrats, at least a little), in absence of its passage, the option Democrats are left with is to continue to win elections.

Release of Census Bureau Data Will Mark Start of Redistricting Battles
The New York Times
August 12, 2021 Thursday

The Census Bureau will release data on Thursday, kicking off a huge fight over political redistricting, with control of Congress potentially hanging in the balance.
The Census Bureau will release long-awaited district-level results on Thursday, setting off what is expected to be the most bruising, litigious and consequential redistricting battle in a generation, with control of Congress hanging in the balance and gerrymandering threatening to lock in quasi-permanent majorities in state legislatures across the country. 
  With Democrats clinging to a slim margin in the House of Representatives, control of the chamber in 2022 could be decided through congressional redistricting alone: Republican-leaning states like Texas and Florida are adding new seats through reapportionment, and G.O.P.-dominated state legislatures will steer much more of the redistricting process, allowing them to draw more maps than Democrats.
  In a matter of days -- if history is any guide -- as soon as state officials can crunch census data files into their more modern formats, an intense process of mapmaking, political contention, legal wrangling, well-financed opinion-shaping and ornery public feedback will unfold in statehouses, courthouses, on the air and even in regions of special contention.
  The redistricting fight arrives amid one of the most protracted assaults on voting access since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, an effort that has made the right to vote among the most divisive issues in American politics. And redistricting will take place this fall without critical guardrails that the Voting Rights Act had erected: a process known as preclearance that ensured oversight of states with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court effectively neutered that provision in a 2013 ruling, meaning that it could take lawsuits -- and years -- to force the redrawing of districts that dilute the voting power of minority communities.
  The looming nationwide struggle over congressional and state legislative maps will also occur on an extraordinarily accelerated timeline. The necessary census data is arriving months later than normal because of pandemic-related delays, leaving state legislatures, independent commissions and others responsible for drawing new maps to work extremely quickly to establish new districts before primary contests begin next year.
  The compressed schedule has already led to some pre-emptive lawsuits, mostly filed by Democrats, even before any maps were drawn. The two parties and allied outside groups have set aside tens of millions of dollars to pay for legal challenges.
  ''For both parties, redistricting is like an amped-up war this cycle,'' said Michael Li, a senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. ''Whatever it takes, people will do.''
  Despite the pressure to hurry, it could be September before mapmakers are able to give much indication of how new districts are shaping up, further ratcheting up the pressure on states with constitutional mandates to finish redistricting this calendar year.
  In the decade since the last round of map-drawing, two Supreme Court decisions have altered the landscape for Democrats, voting-rights groups and civil rights leaders in pushing back against what they deem egregious gerrymandering.
  In 2019, the high court ruled that gerrymandering for partisan gain was beyond the reach of federal courts, leaving such claims to be argued at the state level. Gerrymandering to dilute minority voting power is still illegal under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, but experts worry that now it could be possible to disguise a racial gerrymander as a partisan one.
  More concerning for voting rights groups was the 2013 ruling's removal of the preclearance requirement in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. While preclearance scarcely prevented all gerrymandering, experts argue that it created a deterrent and that its absence this year opens the door to abuse.
  ''I am up late at night often, unable to sleep, pondering how bad or how aggressive some of those states might be in undoing the protections that were granted from Section 5 that no longer are in effect,'' said Jonathan Cervas, a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University who studies gerrymandering. ''And I can imagine that a particularly aggressive legislature, where it benefits them, may not draw minority districts.''
  As Republican maps are drawn, Democratic and civil rights watchdogs will especially scrutinize them for two gerrymandering tactics commonly known as cracking and packing. Cracking splits a minority community into many different districts to water down its impact, and is often a fear in cities. Packing combines many minority voters into a single district, diluting their overall voice in a state, and is more commonly tried in rural areas.
  While diluting the votes of minority communities remains illegal, Mr. Cervas said that without preclearance, such tactics could be used anyway, and that the resulting legal challenges were increasingly unlikely to be resolved in time to affect the 2022 elections.
  Mindful of the calendar, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group founded by former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., has already begun litigating in Louisiana, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.
  Kelly Ward Burton, the group's president, said it was not about to wait. ''If and when they gerrymander, which we expect them to, we will be ready to sue them,'' she said. ''We will use all of the legal tools at our disposal, which is everything from federal litigation to state-based litigation based on state law.''
  Ms. Ward Burton said her group was particularly focused on Texas, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina, which together account for about 21 percent of House seats and where Republicans control the entire redistricting process.
  A spokeswoman for the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the party's main mapmaking organization, declined to comment. But Adam Kincaid, the group's executive director, said in an interview this year that it would be ''defending maps drawn by Republican legislatures and also being more aggressive about going after Democrat gerrymanders in the blue states.''
  Democrats failed to make significant gains in state legislative contests last year, leaving Republicans with complete control over the redistricting process in 20 states. Democrats control the process in just 10 states, and there are divided governments in four. The rest rely on nonpartisan or bipartisan entities to draw political maps, or only have one congressional district in the state.
  That gives Republicans unimpeded control to draw 187 House districts, and Democrats 84.
  A first major skirmish could come in Texas, a state formerly subject to preclearance, where Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor's office and have pledged to call a special legislative session to work on redistricting.
  Texas has a long history of discrimination in its map drawing, and as recently as 2017, two congressional districts were invalidated by a federal court for diluting minority votes. The Legislature is also in a partisan standoff over legislation that would usher in a host of new restrictions on voting.
  Edward B. Foley, an election law professor at Ohio State University, called the Texas voting curbs ''noxious'' but warned that ''redistricting in Texas is going to be more consequential in terms of who holds political power.'' 
  While Democratic legislatures have not gerrymandered as successfully as Republican ones in recent years, there are exceptions: Maryland, for example, is among the most gerrymandered states in the country, according to a 2014 study by The Washington Post.
  Democrats could also try to counter Republican gerrymandering with more partisan maps in the states that they fully control. ''The question is whether or not in New York, in Illinois, the Democrats are going to kind of fight fire with fire,'' Mr. Foley said.
  In the 2010 redistricting cycle, Republicans capitalized on big legislative gains by drawing hugely favorable maps in a number of states, The Associated Press found, allowing them to win more House and legislative seats than their share of those states' electorates would indicate.
  Today, many congressional districts that are not remotely competitive exist in states with razor-thin statewide partisan margins. In Georgia, where President Biden won by less than 0.25 percent, the average margin of the elections for its 14 House seats was roughly 33 percentage points, Mr. Foley said. Four of those races had margins greater than 50 points, and just two were within 10 points.
  Critics of gerrymandering point to glimmers of hope: Political maps are already extremely gerrymandered, making it difficult to increase their partisan tilts. Some states that drew extensively gerrymandered maps, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, now have divided government; others, like Michigan, have adopted independent redistricting commissions.
  It is also at least still theoretically possible that Democrats in Congress will overcome Republican opposition and pass the For the People Act, which has some protections against excessive partisan gerrymandering, including new enforceable criteria as a way to short-circuit protracted litigation.
  Before dawn on Wednesday, however, Senate Republicans again blocked Democratic attempts to debate a version of that legislation. Then the Senate adjourned for its August recess.

Voting Rights Groups Send Letter to Biden Pressing Him to Act

The president is increasingly at odds with leaders of the voting rights movement, who see a contrast between his soaring language and his willingness to push Congress to pass federal legislation.
WASHINGTON -- A quiet divide between President Biden and the leaders of the voting rights movement burst into the open on Thursday, as 150 organizations urged him to use his political mettle to push for two expansive federal voting rights bills that would combat a Republican wave of balloting restrictions. 
  In the letter, signed by civil rights groups including the Leadership Conference and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, activists argued that with the ''ideal of bipartisan cooperation on voting rights'' nowhere to be found in a sharply divided Senate, Mr. Biden must ''support the passage of these bills by whatever means necessary.''
  The issue is of paramount importance to Democrats: Republicans have passed roughly 30 laws in states across the country this year that are likely to make voting harder, especially in Black and Latino communities, which lean Democratic. Several of the laws give state legislators more power over how elections are run and make it easier to challenge the results.
  In a fiery speech in Philadelphia last week, Mr. Biden warned that the G.O.P. effort was the ''most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War.''
  But the president and voting rights advocates are increasingly in disagreement about how to pass that test.
  Mr. Biden, a veteran of the Senate who for decades has believed in negotiating on the particulars of voting rights legislation, has faced calls to push Democratic senators to eliminate the filibuster, which would allow the two major voting bills proposed by the party to pass with a simple majority. The president and his advisers have repeatedly pointed out that he does not have the votes within his own party to pass federal voting legislation, and does not have the power to unilaterally roll back the filibuster even if he supported doing so.
  But voting rights groups say that Mr. Biden is not expending sufficient political capital or using the full force of his bully pulpit to persuade Congress. They point to the contrast between his soaring language -- ''Jim Crow on steroids,'' he has called the G.O.P. voting laws -- and his opposition to abolishing the Senate filibuster.
  ''As you noted in your speech, our democracy is in peril,'' the groups said in their letter. ''We certainly cannot allow an arcane Senate procedural rule to derail efforts that a majority of Americans support.''
  Ultimately, the advocates fear that the Biden administration -- currently focused on a bipartisan infrastructure deal and an ambitious spending proposal -- has largely accepted the Republican restrictions as baked in, and is now dedicating more of its effort to juicing Democratic turnout.
  In private calls with voting rights groups and civil rights leaders, White House officials and close allies of the president have expressed confidence that it is possible to ''out-organize voter suppression,'' according to multiple people familiar with the conversations.
  ''I have heard an emphasis on organizing,'' said Sherrilyn A. Ifill, the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who visited the Oval Office to meet with the president two weeks ago. But, she added, ''we cannot litigate our way out of this and we cannot organize our way out of this.''
  Several Biden advisers involved in the private calls said this week that they did not recall telling attendees that voter suppression could be out-organized, but said organizing was integral to the administration's efforts.
  Broadly, Mr. Biden's advisers insist that the administration is committed to protecting access to the ballot and passing two federal bills: the For the People Act, an overhaul of federal election laws that was considered more of a political statement than viable legislation when it was first introduced in 2019, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore important parts of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court stripped away in 2013.
  Republicans have castigated the For the People Act as overreaching and partisan. And Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, has said there is no need for a bill restoring parts of the Voting Rights Act.
  White House officials privately note that even if Mr. Biden came out in support of ending the filibuster, moderate Democrats, including Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have publicly resisted such a move. Mr. Manchin has also called the For the People Act a piece of ''partisan'' legislation.
  When asked whether the administration's focus had shifted toward political organizing and opposing the G.O.P. laws in the courts, the officials say that critics who are focused on federal voting protections are misinterpreting the president's public remarks.
  Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden and a former congressman from Louisiana, said in an interview that advocates who have zeroed in on Mr. Biden's comments about organizing should see them as one part of the administration's broader work on voting rights.
  ''I think it's very clear what he said,'' Mr. Richmond said of the president's speech in Philadelphia. ''Which is: We're going to have to meet this challenge in the courts, in the halls of Congress and in the streets.''
  But in interviews, more than 20 civil rights leaders and voting rights advocates said that while they believed in Mr. Biden's conviction to protect the right to vote, they thought his call for a ''new coalition'' of Americans to take up the issue was not what they needed from the White House.
  Some advocates found this approach -- the idea that the vaunted voter registration, education and get-out-the-vote efforts that helped propel Mr. Biden to victory could be used against G.O.P. voting laws -- naïve at best, signaling that the White House viewed the issue as simply an election challenge, rather than a moral threat to broad civil rights progress.
  ''The notion that some new coalition can be formed that would allow for greater efforts at organizing and voter turnout is perhaps a bit unrealistic,'' said Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ''We have already formed one of the most diverse and strongest coalitions in support of voting rights that ever existed. At the end of the day, that is inadequate to the challenge of the moment. We need federal legislation.''
  Voting rights advocates have taken note of the fact that Mr. Biden, who has publicly negotiated with holdout senators from both parties for his stimulus and infrastructure proposals, has yet to openly exert similar pressure on senators when it comes to voting rights.
  For his part, Mr. Biden has at times appeared frustrated about the slim odds voting rights bills face in the Senate.
  ''I hear all the folks on TV saying, 'Why doesn't Biden get this done?''' he said during a speech in Tulsa, Okla., last month. ''Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.''
  Mr. Biden's aides say the way forward must be based partly on education, because the new Republican laws will add complications to voting like making it harder to cast a ballot early or by mail, limiting drop boxes and shortening early voting periods.
  The president signed an executive order this year directing all federal agencies to find ways to make it as easy as possible to register Americans to vote. In a speech this month, Vice President Kamala Harris said the Democratic National Committee would dedicate $25 million to an effort to educate voters.
  Inside the White House, officials say they are hard at work bringing together voting rights advocates, poll workers and others who can tell them more about problems on the ground. Dozens of advisers hold several meetings a day on the subject. The president requests updates on the issue daily, according to three advisers familiar with his schedule.
  Progressive groups and advocates say the White House should have a larger role to play.
  ''Talking about grass-roots organizing, talking about voter registration is important, and we are grateful for the amplification of what our work is -- and I want to be clear that that's our work,'' said Nsé Ufot, the executive director of the New Georgia Project, a civil rights group. ''That's what we've been doing. That's what got us to this moment. That's what gave us a Biden-Harris administration. And now we need them to do their jobs. I can't write legislation. I can't whip votes. I don't have 47 years in that body, in the United States Senate. I'm not the president of that body. But they are.''
  The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, the founder of the Poor People's Campaign and a prominent civil rights leader, urged Mr. Biden to wield his influence. ''Go to Texas, and meet with a diverse group of people on the ground to put a face on this issue. Then go to Arizona. Go to West Virginia,'' he said. ''There ought to be a speech from the well of Congress.''
  Democrats have been blanketing the airwaves, outspending Republicans on ads related to voting by $9.2 million to $1.6 million across the country, though the bulk of the money has come from left-leaning outside groups like End Citizens United, Fair Fight Action and Fix Our Senate.
  ''We need more from the president,'' said Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate. ''It's only through his leadership, frankly, that we have any hope of passing voting rights legislation before it's too late.''

Activists are pressing for Democrats to try again to bring up an elections overhaul bill, anticipating that Republicans would block it and intensify pressure to eliminate the filibuster.
President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the top Democrats in Congress met at the White House on Friday to discuss their party’s faltering efforts to pass major voting rights legislation.
Mr. Biden’s meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York came at a crucial moment, as activists are pushing the president to use his power and Democrats’ control of Congress to protect voting rights while they have the chance. Republican-led states have enacted at least 30 new laws containing a host of new restrictions on voting, and G.O.P. senators have blocked consideration of a Democratic bill that would impose sweeping new federal mandates aimed at overriding them.
Party leaders do not have many options to break through the gridlock. In June, Republicans successfully stalled Democrats’ marquee elections legislation, called the For the People Act, by filibusteringit. Democrats’ hopes of changing Senate filibuster rules to bypass Republicans have flagged as a few holdouts within the party continue to oppose such a move. And their window for legislative action is narrow.
Democrats are close to finalizing a scaled-back bill that activists hope could be a battering ram in the fight over the filibuster. The party is also readying legislation to reinforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and lawmakers have discussed tucking voting provisions into the $3.5 trillion budget plan advancing in the Senate, which they can push through unilaterally over the opposition of Republicans. But the G.O.P. is largely opposed to all three.
In a statement after the meeting, the White House called passing legislation on the issue a “moral imperative.”
“Recognizing the challenges ahead, the four leaders agreed on the importance of advancing legislation reflecting the priorities and values of those two bills, having them pass the House of Representatives and the Senate, and withstand constitutional challenge,” the statement said.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, confirmed on Thursday that a small group of Democratic senators had been meeting to hash out a revised bill that could be released in the coming days. Among them is Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a moderate who balked at some of the more expansive proposals in the For the People Act and has been a determined holdout on keeping the filibuster intact.
“This isn’t one of these ‘Oh, maybe we’ll get it done,’” Ms. Klobuchar said on Thursday during a call hosted by SiX Action, a progressive group, saying the emerging measure would have provisions on gerrymandering, voting by mail and automatic voter registration. “We are very close to getting an agreement on that bill.”
There is no indication that an accord among a small group of Democrats would draw any more Republican backing than previous proposals have. But activists and progressives want to see the revised measure come up for a vote before the Senate leaves Washington for its August recess, anticipating that it would fail and intensify pressure to dismantle the filibuster.
Mr. Schumer has yet to commit to a timeline, and it is unclear if he would want a full-fledged filibuster fight playing out just as he and Mr. Biden are trying to maneuver a bipartisan infrastructure bill through the Senate.
The revised elections legislation is built around a rough framework provided by Mr. Manchin earlier this year. It is expected to mandate that states provide 15 days of early, in-person voting, including at least two Sundays; a national expansion of mail-in voting; an end to partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts; a national voter identification requirement; and campaign finance provisions that would require super PACs to disclose the identities of their big donors.
The bill’s authors also plan to include language intended to undercut state laws in places like Georgia that they believe would allow Republican elected officials to subvert the results of an election to favor their candidates. Federal lawmakers specifically want to make it harder for their state counterparts to remove local election officials and harder for partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and election workers. They also want to make the process of challenging any individual’s ability to register to vote more difficult.

A Pyrrhic Victory in a Broken Senate; Guest Essay

Around the time of the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, in March, the political commentariat devoted a lot of airtime and column inches to a telling question: What lessons had President Biden and the Democratic Party learned from the Obama era? Congressional Democrats passed the relief bill on a party-line vote. Watering it down to achieve bipartisan support would have been a “mistake,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, said at the time, one that Democrats would not be making again. The administration had only so much time, after all, to try to pass the most pro-worker labor reforms in a generation or to put an end to congressional malapportionment.
Well, now it’s August, and Congress has not passed either of those things (or a serious climate bill or major health care reform or immigration reform). Instead, we might soon get a larger than usual bipartisan highway bill, if the Senate manages to pass it before heading off for recess.
What may appear to be an imminent victory for bipartisan deal-making was in fact a drawn-out demonstration of how broken the Senate is as an institution. The Senate (with the White House’s support) wasted months cajoling and rehabilitating a handful of key Republicans, only to pass a smaller version of something Democrats could theoretically have passed entirely on their own. Moving the bill forward looks like a victory only if one accepts the sclerosis and dysfunction of the Senate as a natural obstacle to be overcome with cunning and patience, not a self-imposed limitation on effective and responsive governance.
The Democrats, of course, have the slimmest possible Senate vote margin, and the party’s right flank — Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema in particular — made it clear that they did not support eliminating the Senate’s de facto 60 vote requirement for legislation. Mr. Biden’s full infrastructure plan would not have passed with 51 votes the day after the Covid relief bill even if he had tried to do it that way.
So the White House, early on, threw itself into trying to hash out a bipartisan bill (and then, they promise, a more ambitious reconciliation attempt) with the gusto of a group very used to brokering bipartisan megadeals that (more often than not, in recent history) fall apart at the last moment. Any White House effort to get two Democratic senators, Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema, on board without also bringing along at least 10 of their Republican friends was quickly thrown aside. In fact, as White House insiders told political reporters last spring, holding extended bipartisan negotiations that fall apart at the last moment was the plan for winning the support of Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema.
From a policy perspective, splitting the proposal in two makes little sense. If the Democrats manage to carry out the second half of their plans and pass a broader bill with even more funding for infrastructure later this fall, they will have achieved the same result — just a lot slower than if they had allowed these negotiations to die months ago and moved forward with reconciliation on their own. Keeping the two bills separate really makes sense only to those whose minds have been warped by spending multiple years in that strangest legislative body, the U.S. Senate. There politicians learn that the deal is the goal in and of itself and whatever it does or doesn’t do is of secondary importance.
Mr. Biden and Senate Democrats set out to prove that their preferred way of doing business still works, and they did: The Senate can still function, not by just doing something but by taking a very long time to do half of something, on a bipartisan basis, with a dubious promise to finish the rest later.
This bipartisan infrastructure bill is popular (and much of the spending is urgently needed throughout the country). Infrastructure spending, like bipartisanship, usually is. But having to spend so much time tortuously wringing support from the minority party to spend money on things people need and want is not actually a sign of a healthy system of government. Doing what’s necessary and popular shouldn’t be the hard part of governing, requiring painful compromise.
As for whether the Biden administration has learned from past mistakes, it’s now clear that the urgency and speed shown in his first 100 days was not a sign of a definitive break with past Democratic-controlled governments. Whatever lessons the president and his team learned from the Obama years, “Don’t let the Senate hijack your entire legislative agenda with protracted bipartisan negotiations that constantly threaten to break down entirely” wasn’t one of them.
If the reconciliation scheme fails, the price of bipartisanship will have been many of this infrastructure plan’s most important climate elements, like a federal clean energy standard to speed the national transition to zero-emission electricity. Even if the scheme works, the opportunity cost will end up being lost time that could have been spent trying to achieve all the other things Mr. Biden promised to get done if elected. The time spent finding a way to get 60 votes for the infrastructure bill was time not spent hashing out versions of an infrastructure bill and the PRO Act and the For the People Act that could win 51 votes. A party that seemed briefly to understand the urgency of the moment abandoned any sense of it for the vanity of senators who seem to take pride in spending months trying to find an agreeable midpoint between a large number and a small number.
After all, that was the actual lesson of 2009. Laying the blame for the stimulus act’s inadequacy on the pursuit of bipartisan support, as Mr. Schumer did in March, was always unfair to both Barack Obama and Senator Susan Collins (and too kind to the person primarily responsible for the size of that stimulus, former White House economic adviser Larry Summers). Mr. Obama and the Democrats acted with plenty of urgency. The Recovery Act passed in February of 2009, a month earlier than Mr. Biden got his relief bill done. It was only after the stimulus that Mr. Obama’s entire first term agenda ran aground on the shoal of bipartisan negotiation. Then the Senate got to work.

Our Families Fought for Civil Rights. Don’t Let Jim Crow Stand.; Guest Essay

Byline: Myrlie Evers and Henry Scott Wallace
Highlight: Family members of civil rights icon Medgar Evers and former Vice President Henry A. Wallace lament the filibuster in light of their loved ones&#39; life and work. 
Body




I’m Myrlie Evers. Right before he was murdered, my husband, Medgar Evers, told me, “Don’t ever give up on those things that you believe in.” Medgar and I had a transcendent connection, and these words have lifted my spirits throughout the decades-long fight for justice against Medgar’s assassin, my time at the N.A.A.C.P. and my run for Congress against a far-right extremist. Now, those words guide me whenever I see things Medgar fought and died for being erased by misguided politicians.
I’m Scott Wallace. Nothing inspires me more than the courage of my grandfather, Henry A. Wallace, campaigning for president in the Deep South on a platform to end Jim Crow in 1948, undaunted by death threats. In my career in law and philanthropy, I have been guided every day by his fearless commitment to robust and inclusive democracy, and to an activist role for government on behalf of ordinary Americans.
Medgar Evers grew up in Mississippi during the Depression and fought on the beaches of Normandy, only to come home to witness grotesque inequality and violence against African Americans. He dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for civil rights and voting rights.
Mr. Wallace rose from secretary of agriculture to become Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third-term vice president, but was replaced on the Democratic ticket with Harry Truman in 1944. His calls to end poll taxes outraged party bosses. He never gave up fighting for progressive values and international collaboration toward world peace.
Today, Aug. 6, America commemorates the 56th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. But in the face of a relentless assault from the right — not just on who gets to vote, and how, but on who decides which votes count — there’s more to mourn than to celebrate.
It’s been nearly six decades since Medgar’s assassination and since Henry A. Wallace’s death. Our crusading loved ones must be spinning in their graves.
As of mid-July, Republican-led legislatures in at least 17 states had enacted around 30 restrictive new voting laws, some provisions of which will disproportionately affect racial minorities. In Texas, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum to ram through some of the country’s most restrictive voting laws. Threatened with arrest, they’ve been in Washington, D.C., pushing for new federal laws to safeguard elections nationwide.
The U.S. Supreme Court isn’t helping. Last month, it gutted what’s left of the Voting Rights Act. That ruling came eight years after the court’s misguided decision to kill the Act’s requirement that certain states and counties get federal permission to make changes to their voting laws.
President Biden recently denounced the G.O.P.’s “21st Century Jim Crow assault” on voting rights, and called on Congress to pass legislation to protect voting and elections.
But these bills will die. They will be strangled by the Senate filibuster, a parliamentary tactic that requires a three-fifths supermajority of senators to end debate on most legislation and advance it to a vote. If the Senate were like many other democratic legislative bodies in the world, it would take a simple majority of 51 votes to pass legislation. But today, even though Democrats have 50 votes, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to serve as a 51st vote in the event of a tie, they can accomplish little unless 10 Republicans decide to join them.
But Senate Republicans aren’t joining them. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said “100 percent of our focus is on stopping” Mr. Biden’s administration. He recently led a filibuster to obstruct House-passed legislation to protect elections and voting in America.
Both of our loved ones’ crusading spirits were forged during F.D.R.’s New Deal, when the government responded to great crises with big, bold programs to help everyday Americans. F.D.R.’s example openly inspires President Biden. He keeps F.D.R.’s portrait in the place of honor above the fireplace in the Oval Office. Mr. Biden likes to say that he tells it “straight from the shoulder,” a phrase F.D.R. used when he was president. President Biden has called for the creation of a 21st Century Civilian Climate Corps, modeled on the New Deal’s wildly successful Civilian Conservation Corps.
F.D.R. got 15 major pieces of legislationpassed in his first 100 days. But here’s the great irony: the bills that made up F.D.R.’s New Deal might not have passed muster under today’s Senate filibuster rules. The Senate filibuster has been used to block civil rights bills meant to combat racial discrimination, such as those outlawing lynching and poll taxes — one reason former President Obama has denounced the filibuster as a “Jim Crow relic.”
President Biden’s one major bill succeeded only because it fit a narrow exemption to the filibuster: budget reconciliation. Other House-passed legislation simply dies in the Senate. The New Deal-era “talking” filibuster — a round-the-clock talkathon to dramatize the minority’s opposition — has been replaced by a blanket minority veto of almost every remotely controversial bill.
So Jim Crow lives on, dressed in a business suit in state legislatures and the U.S. Senate. His weapon is the filibuster. And his victims are bills to strengthen democracy and justice such as the For The People Act, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act.
The filibuster is not a creature of law or of the Constitution. It’s a procedural rule. The process of changing it is simple, and not uncommon. It only takes a majority vote of the Senate to create new exceptions to the filibuster’s supermajority requirement. Such exceptions were made 161 times between 1969 and 2014.
Elected leaders in Washington need to reform the racist filibuster and stand up for democracy by passing big, bold legislation to meet the greatest American crises since the 1930s and ’40s. We owe it to the present, the future and the past.

Schumer is said to tell senators to expect votes on voting rights legislation within days.

The move is likely futile amid Republican opposition, but it reflects a sense of urgency among Democrats to act.
Senate Democrats will make another, likely futile, attempt to take up voting rights legislation in the coming days before the chamber leaves Washington for a summer recess, a sign that party leaders remain determined to try to break a logjam on the issue as Republican-led states lock in new ballot restrictions.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, has privately told senators to expect additional votes on the matter on the Senate’s way out of town, according to Democrats familiar with the private discussions, who described them on the condition of anonymity. The development is welcome news for voting rights activists, who have been worried that Democrats’ monthslong push to enact a massive bipartisan infrastructure bill would eclipse voting rights and sap any appetite for an aggressive bid to try to steamroll Republicans and act on it unilaterally.
But the party’s endgame remains far from clear. Republicans have blockedDemocrats’ marquee voting rights legislation once with a filibuster, and have the votes to do so again. As such, Democrats’ only conceivable path forward would require changing the Senate’s filibuster rule. Doing so would require the support of all of their members, including some swing-vote Democrats, like Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who are adamantly opposed.
Democrats are up against an increasingly daunting deadline to act. Lawyers have warned party leaders that any election changes would likely have to take effect in the next month to impact the 2022 balloting. If not, Democrats will be competing in several swing states based on Republican-written rules that they fear will make it harder to turn out voters of color, a key constituency.
“There is a deep sense of urgency among many of us in the caucus,” said Senator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia. “We are witnessing an unabashed assault on voting rights — not just suppression, but an effort to overthrow the results at the local level. And it would be irresponsible for us not to do everything we can to address that.”
The Washington Post earlier reported on Mr. Schumer’s private comments on the matter.
Mr. Warnock, who is running for election next fall, is preparing to compete in a state where Republicans moved decisively this spring to make mail-in voting more difficult, constrain early voting and shift power over elections toward the G.O.P.-led legislature. In an interview, Mr. Warnock said he was all for passing an infrastructure bill, but called it a “mistake” to do so without addressing “the infrastructure of our democracy.”
He and other progressives still hope that they can prevail on moderate holdouts like Mr. Manchin to alter the Senate rules. And they view additional votes on the Senate floor as a key to making their case that Republicans are not willing to find common ground.
As of Thursday, senior Democrats were still trying to hash out what exactly they would vote on in the coming days. Mr. Schumer met on Wednesday with a group of senators working on a scaled-back version of the For the People Act, the sprawling elections overhaul bill that Senate Republicans blocked in June. They believed they could reach agreement among themselves within days.
Party leaders expect their new bill will win support from all 50 Democrats and independents in the Senate, in part by lopping off ethics provisions included in the original bill, scaling back its mandates for automatic voter registration, excising a public campaign financing system for senators and backing off an attempt to change the composition of the Federal Election Commission in favor of other changes.
Democrats are still assembling a second voting rights bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which could come up for a vote both in the House and the Senate in the fall. It would restore key enforcement powers under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.

Biden Portrays A Right to Vote As Under Siege

The president tried to reinvigorate the fight for voting rights, but he made no mention of rolling back the filibuster, which some see as the only way to beat back Republican-led efforts to restrict ballot access.
WASHINGTON -- President Biden said on Tuesday that the fight against restrictive voting laws was the ''most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War'' and called Donald J. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election ''a big lie.'' 
  In an impassioned speech in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden tried to reinvigorate the stalled Democratic effort to pass federal voting rights legislation and called on Republicans ''in Congress and states and cities and counties to stand up, for God's sake.''
  ''Help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our election and the sacred right to vote,'' the president said in remarks at the National Constitution Center. ''Have you no shame?''
  But his words collided with reality: Even as Republican-led bills meant to restrict voting access make their way through statehouses across the country, two bills aiming to expand voting rights nationwide are languishing in Congress. And Mr. Biden has bucked increasing pressure from Democrats to support pushing the legislation through the Senate by eliminating the filibuster, no matter the political cost.
  In fact, the president seemed to acknowledge that the legislation had little hope of passing as he shifted his focus to the midterm elections.
  ''We're going to face another test in 2022,'' Mr. Biden said. ''A new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now.''
  He said he would start an effort ''to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote and then get the vote out.''
  The partisan fight over voting rights was playing out even as the president spoke, with a group of Texas Democrats fleeing their state to deny Republicans the quorum they need to pass new voting restrictions there.
  In his speech, Mr. Biden characterized the conspiracy theories about the 2020 election -- hatched and spread by his predecessor, Mr. Trump -- as a ''darker and more sinister'' underbelly of American politics. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name but warned that ''bullies and merchants of fear'' had posed an existential threat to democracy.
  ''No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny, such high standards,'' Mr. Biden said. ''The big lie is just that: a big lie.''
  About a dozen Republican-controlled states passed laws this spring to restrict voting or significantly change election rules, in part because of Mr. Trump's efforts to sow doubt about the 2020 results.
  Republicans, who have called Democrats' warnings about democracy hyperbolic, argue that laws are needed to tamp down on voter fraud, despite evidence that it is not a widespread problem. They have mounted an aggressive campaign to portray Mr. Biden's voting-rights efforts as self-serving federalization of elections to benefit Democrats.
  The president's speech, delivered against the backdrop of the birthplace of American democracy, was intended to present the right to vote as a shared ideal, despite the realities of a deeply fractured political landscape.
  Democratic efforts to pass voting rights legislation in Washington have stalled in the evenly divided Senate. Last month, Republicans filibustered the broad elections overhaul known as the For the People Act, and they are expected to do the same if Democrats try to bring up the other measure -- the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, named for a former Georgia congressman and civil rights icon -- which would restore parts of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.
  In a statement, Danielle Álvarez, the communications director for the Republican National Committee, said that Mr. Biden's speech amounted to ''lies and theatrics.'' Republicans had unanimously rejected the For the People Act as a Democratic attempt to ''pass their federal takeover of our elections,'' she said.
  There were also concerns among more moderate members of Mr. Biden's party that the legislation was too partisan. Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have publicly said they would not support rolling back the filibuster to enact it.
  But other Democrats see a worrying increase in efforts by Republican-led state legislatures to restrict voting, along with court rulings that would make it harder to fight encroachments on voting rights.
  A Supreme Court ruling this month weakened the one enforcement clause of the Voting Rights Act that remained after the court invalidated its major provision in 2013. Mr. Biden said last year that strengthening the act would be one of his first priorities after taking office; but on Tuesday, he sought to shift responsibility to lawmakers.
  ''The court's decision, as harmful as it is, does not limit the Congress's ability to repair the damage done,'' the president said. ''As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and want the whole world to see it.''
  His rallying cry only underscored the impossibility of the task: Neither bill currently has a path to his desk.
  Activists who had wondered whether Mr. Biden would stake out a public position on the filibuster got their answer on Tuesday: ''I'm not filibustering now,'' the president told reporters who shouted questions after his speech.
  ''It was strange to hear,'' Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for the anti-filibuster group Fix Our Senate, said after watching the speech. ''He did a great job of laying out the problem, but then stopped short of talking about the actual solution that would be needed to passing legislation to address the problem.''
  As Mr. Biden spoke in Philadelphia, the group of Texas Democrats had traveled to Washington, where they were trying to delay state lawmakers from taking up restrictive voting measures.
  Both measures would ban 24-hour voting and drive-through voting; prohibit election officials from proactively sending absentee ballot applications to voters who had not requested them; add new voter identification requirements for voting by mail; limit the types of assistance that can be provided to voters; and greatly expand the authority and autonomy of partisan poll watchers.
  In Austin, Republicans vented their anger at the fleeing group, and Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to call ''special session after special session after special session'' until an election bill passed. The handful of Democratic lawmakers who did not go to Washington were rounded up and ordered onto the Statehouse floor. Shawn Thierry, a Democratic state representative from Houston, posted to Twitter a video of a Statehouse sergeant-at-arms and a state trooper entering her office to order her to be locked in the House chamber.
  ''This is not an issue about Democrats or Republicans,'' Vice President Kamala Harris told the Texas lawmakers when she met with them on Tuesday. ''This is about Americans and how Americans are experiencing this issue.''
  James Talarico, 32, the youngest member of the Texas Legislature, said the group of Democrats had gone to Washington, in part, to pressure Mr. Biden to do more.
  ''We can't listen to more speeches,'' Mr. Talarico said. ''I'm incredibly proud not only as a Democrat but also an American of what President Biden has accomplished in his first few months in office. But protecting our democracy should have been at the very top of the list, because without it none of these issues matter.''
  The restrictions in the Texas bills mirror key provisions of a restrictive law passed this year in Georgia, which went even further to assert Republican control over the State Election Board and empower the party to suspend county election officials. In June, the Justice Department sued Georgia over the law, the Biden administration's first significant move to challenge voter restrictions at the state level.
  ''The 21st-century Jim Crow assault is real,'' Mr. Biden said as he listed the details of the Texas bills. ''It's unrelenting, and we are going to challenge it vigorously.''

After fleeing to Washington, Democratic state lawmakers urged Congress to pass major voting rights legislation. Back in Austin, Republicans carried out the mostly symbolic passage of their elections bill in the State Senate.
WASHINGTON -- Texas lawmakers traveled down starkly divergent political paths on Tuesday, as Republicans in Austin signaled their intention to push forward with an overhaul of the state's election system while Democrats who had fled the state a day earlier began lobbying lawmakers in Congress to pass comprehensive federal voting rights legislation. 
  While Democrats celebrated their success in temporarily delaying the Republican bill, they confronted a much bigger long-term challenge: There is little the party can do to stop Republicans from ultimately passing a wide array of voting restrictions, with Gov. Greg Abbott vowing to call ''special session after special session after special session'' until an election bill is passed.
  But Democrats, as long as they remain away from Texas, appear likely to be able to hold off the G.O.P. effort for now. Chris Turner, the Democratic leader in the Texas State House, said that 57 members of the party's delegation were now absent from Austin, more than the 51 necessary to stop business from proceeding. They have pledged to remain in Washington for the duration of the Texas session, and Republicans do not appear to have a legal way to bring them back from Washington.
  ''Best I know, Texas law enforcement doesn't have jurisdiction outside the state of Texas,'' Mr. Turner said Tuesday outside the Capitol.
  On Tuesday evening, in a vote that was by turns symbolic and incremental, the Texas State Senate passed Republicans' sweeping election overhaul bill by a party-line vote of 18 to 4; the nine Democratic senators who did not cast a vote had left Austin to join the House Democrats who fled the state on Monday.
  Without a quorum in the House, any bill passed by the Senate cannot advance, effectively killing any bill for this session and rendering most votes in the Senate as more of a messaging tactic to demonstrate Senate Republicans' resolve to pass an election bill.
  But in the event that House Democrats do return to the Capitol during this special session (they have pledged to remain in Washington for the duration), the bill would still be considered live and ready for the House to take it up should it choose to do so.
  In the meantime, furious Texas Republicans sought on Tuesday to pursue other means of retribution against the Democratic lawmakers, with Mr. Abbott threatening to detain them as soon as they returned to the state, and other G.O.P. leaders warning that they might remove Democrats from leadership positions in the Legislature.
  Even as national Democrats celebrated the state lawmakers who fled, the party faces wrenching disagreements over its strategy on voting rights. With President Biden facing rising pressure from Democrats to treat voting as a top priority, he gave an impassioned speech on the issue in Philadelphia on Tuesday, and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Texas lawmakers shortly after the president's speech.
  In his speech, Mr. Biden forcefully reiterated his desire to pass federal voting legislation and lashed out at Republicans for seeking to make voting harder and to make it easier to challenge the results of future elections. ''Have you no shame?'' he asked.
  ''We must pass the For the People Act,'' Mr. Biden said. ''It's a national imperative.''
  But in the roughly 23-minute address, the president remained silent on the filibuster, which stands in the way of any voting legislation in the Senate, and offered few specifics on how Democrats might pass a voting bill through a narrowly divided Congress.
  Ms. Harris, appearing with senior members of the White House political strategy office, was greeted with a standing ovation by the Texas lawmakers, as she reiterated the administration's commitment to voting rights.
  ''I know what you have done comes with great sacrifice, both personal and political,'' Ms. Harris said, according to pool reports.
  In Texas itself, Democrats were not entirely united, with some members of the party's Senate delegation failing to follow their House counterparts in blocking a quorum. While several Democratic state senators decamped to Washington, four of the 13 Democrats in the State Senate remained in Austin on Tuesday morning.
  ''I understand the bold action'' of House representatives and state senators leaving, State Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston, said in a brief interview in his office shortly before heading to the Senate chamber. ''I personally think you have to make a decision where you think you're going to be most effective, and I think today mine's on the Senate floor.''
  Republicans in Texas, for their part, denounced Democrats' decision to flee.
  ''This is political theater, by and for Texas Democrats,'' State Representative Jim Murphy, the chair of the Republican House caucus in Texas, said at a news conference hours after House Republicans voted to send law enforcement to track down missing members. ''These Democrats have walked off the job twice now, and abandoned their obligation to represent you.''
  Republicans in the House spent the majority of the news conference highlighting other issues -- like changes to Child Protective Services, teacher salaries and health benefits -- that would no longer receive time on the floor.
  ''If Democrat members of the House care about the children, they will come home and fight for them to get the safety and protection that they need,'' said State Representative Jacey Jetton, a Republican from outside Houston.
  The current special session was called by Mr. Abbott after Democrats in the House stymied Republicans' original election overhaul bill in May by using a similar walkout tactic, though in that case they merely fled the chamber, not the state.
  In Washington on Tuesday, outside the Capitol under a scorching morning sun, 47 Democratic Texas state representatives urged the White House and Senate Democrats to push for the For the People Act, the party's major federal voting legislation that has faltered because of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass most bills.
  The lawmakers tried to deflect Republican criticism that they were abdicating their legislative responsibilities, saying that they were in Washington on a ''working trip.''
  ''I'm not up here to take a vacation,'' said State Representative Senfronia Thompson, who was first elected to represent her Houston-area district in 1972. ''We have fought too long and too hard in this country, and it was a Texan called Johnson, President Lyndon B. Johnson, on Aug. 6, 1965, who made sure that we had the right to vote.''
  The Texas lawmakers planned to split up in groups to talk with Democratic senators. Meetings were scheduled on Tuesday with Chuck Schumer, the majority leader; Cory Booker of New Jersey; Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; and Alex Padilla of California.
  They had not yet succeeded in securing an audience with Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who along with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia has made herself a stalwart defender of the 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation. But the Texans are expected to meet with Mr. Manchin later this week, an aide to the senator said.
  ''We have got to get in to see Sinema,'' said Jasmine Crockett, a state representative from Dallas.
  In Austin, where the State House had no business to conduct, members mingled among themselves and browsed on their computers. Doors to the chamber were locked -- and permission slips were required to leave -- after members voted 76-to-4 to place a ''call on the House'' and order law enforcement to round up missing members. The dissenting votes came from the four remaining Democrats.
  To prevent Republicans from passing their election bill in the current special session, which began on July 8 and will last for 30 days, Democratic state representatives must stay out of the state for more than three weeks. After that, Mr. Abbott could call a new special session.
  The election legislation that Republicans have proposed is very similar to the bill the party originally introduced this year, with restrictions on voting that would most likely have a disproportionate impact on poorer communities and communities of color, especially in Harris County, the largest county in the state, which is trending Democratic.
  The new bills, introduced in the State House and State Senate, include provisions aimed at Harris County, including bans on drive-through voting and 24-hour voting, two new voting methods that were pioneered by the county last year. Nearly 140,000 voters in Harris County used one of the two methods in 2020.
  The bills also include broad statewide changes, including new identification requirements for absentee ballots and a measure that prohibits election officials and third-party groups from proactively sending absentee ballot applications to voters who have not requested them.
  For voting rights groups and Democrats, some of the most worrying provisions in the Texas bills are ones that would greatly expand the authority and autonomy of partisan poll watchers. Originally meant to serve as an outside check on the electoral process for candidates and political parties, poll watchers have become increasingly aggressive in some states, including Texas.
  That has raised fears that poll watchers, as they have repeatedly in American elections over the years, will increasingly be used to intimidate voters and election workers, often in Democratic-leaning communities of color. During the 2020 election, President Donald J. Trump's campaign promoted its ''army'' of poll watchers as he implored supporters to venture into heavily Black and Latino cities and hunt for voter fraud.
  Democrats were able to gain some minor concessions in the bill. A ballot-curing provision -- which allows voters to fix their ballot if there were any problems with it -- was added, and an extra hour of early in-person voting was added for weekday voting. Two of the most controversial provisions from the original bill -- a limit on Sunday voting and a measure making it easier to overturn election results -- were also removed from the current versions, which meant that the bills no longer include measures allowing for a significant partisan takeover of election administration, of the kind that Republicans have passed in Georgia, Arkansas and other states.

Bans on ballot collection. Limits on vote-by-mail drop boxes. Shorter hours at polling places. Across the country, Republican legislatures are passing laws to make it harder to vote. Which is why, for proponents of expansive voting rights, the Supreme Court decision last week upholding two such laws could scarcely have come at a worse time.
“What is tragic here is that the court has (yet again) rewritten — in order to weaken — a statute that stands as a monument to America’s greatness, and protects against its basest impulses,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, which was joined by the two other liberal justices. “What is tragic is that the court has damaged a statute designed to bring about ‘the end of discrimination in voting.’”
Kagan was referring to the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 legislation often described as “the crown jewel” of the civil rights movement. How much power will this decision strip from the law, and what role will it play in the larger battle over the freedom and fairness of American elections? Here’s what people are saying.
Inside the decision
The case concerned a pair of voting restrictions in Arizona: one that required election officials to discard ballots cast at the wrong precinct and another that made it a crime for most people to collect ballots for delivery to polling places, a practice that critics call “ballot harvesting.”
•	Democrats argued those rules end up disproportionately affecting voters of color, therefore violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. (I should mention here that my brother was part of the legal team that argued this case before the court.) Ballot collection, for example, is widely used by Arizona’s Native population, some of whom live far from polling places and lack easy access to mail services.
•	The attorney general of Arizona defended the laws as necessary protections against threats to election integrity, such as voter fraud — which is largely nonexistent. (The 2020 presidential election “was the most secure in American history,” U.S. officials have said.) In oral arguments in March, an attorney representing the Arizona Republican Party was blunt about the party’s interest in the case:
The ruling: The court concluded that the burdens imposed by the laws were acceptably modest. “Voting takes time and, for almost everyone, some travel, even if only to a nearby mailbox,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. “Mere inconvenience cannot be enough.” Moreover, Alito argued, the racial disparity in the laws’ impact was too small to violate the Voting Rights Act.
The court did not establish an ironclad test for lower courts to apply in cases challenging voting laws like Arizona’s, but it did set up five “guideposts” that some legal experts say will favor restrictions.
The big picture: This ruling comes eight years after the Supreme Court effectively annulled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which required states and local governments to clear in advance any voting rule changes with the federal government if those states had a history of discrimination. Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion in that case said that plaintiffs could still seek redress under Section 2 of the law, which allows after-the-fact litigation against any legislation that discriminates on the basis of race, intentionally or not.
But now, the Voting Rights Act “retains only limited power to combat voting restrictions said to disproportionately affect minority voters’ access to the polls,” The Times’s Adam Liptak writes.
Is the Voting Rights Act dead?
Since November, at least 22 laws have been enacted in 14 states that impose new restrictions on voting. While there are other legal avenues to challenge these laws — including the First, 14th and 15th Amendments — the precedent established in this case suggests that the Supreme Court will not be inclined to overturn them under the Voting Rights Act.
“It is hard to see what laws would be so burdensome that they would flunk the majority’s lax test,” Richard L. Hasen writes in The Times. “A ban on Sunday voting despite African American and other religious voters doing ‘souls to the polls’ drives after church? New strict identification requirements for those voting by mail? More frequent voter purges? All would probably be OK under the court’s new test as long as there are still some opportunities for minority citizens to vote — somewhere, somehow.”
But others are slightly less pessimistic. Ian Millhiser argues at Vox that while the case, Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, “is a blow to liberal democracy, it is not an apocalypse.” He notes that the opinion is limited in scope to “cases involving neutral time, place and manner rules” governing elections, likely preserving the ability to challenge many of the most restrictive voting laws being pushed around the country. “From a 6-3 court, Alito’s Brnovich decision is probably the best that both large-D Democrats and small-d democrats could have hoped for.”
Allison Riggs, a senior lawyer at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, took a similar view. “This decision overly constricts how we view evidence in our Section 2 cases, and that’s going to make it harder — not unwinnable — but harder,” she told The Times.
What’s next
For many Democrats and voting rights activists, this latest decision adds more urgency to the congressional push to enact two voting laws that would effectively prevent states from limiting access to the ballot: The For the People Act, a sweeping overhaul of federal election and campaigning laws, and the narrower John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.
“Many of the provisions in the state Republican-enacted voter-suppression laws popping up after the 2020 election would be flatly (and retroactively) prohibited” by the For the People Act, Ed Kilgore explains in New York magazine. The narrower bill, by contrast, “would simply stop future laws and procedural changes from taking effect without a Justice Department preclearance.”
Even those bills, though, may not be sufficient to turn back the anti-democratic tide, the Times editorial board argues. That’s because Republican lawmakers around the country are not only making it more difficult to vote, but also changing the rules around how votes are counted and certified. “These laws are of a piece with the voting restrictions being passed by the same lawmakers,” the board writes. “Together, they are designed to keep Democratic-leaning voters away from the polls, and to the extent that fails, to deny victory to Democratic candidates, even when they win more votes.”
In any case, the odds of either bill passing seem slim. Republican senators blocked debate last week on the For the People Act and only one, Lisa Murkowski, has signaled her support for the Voting Rights Advancement Act. That means Democrats would have to change Senate filibuster rules, which Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin remain opposed to doing. “Democrats claim that democracy is under threat, but they lack the collective will to save it,” Russell Berman writes in The Atlantic.
If Republican efforts succeed, the right to vote may become increasingly polarized along geographic lines: Despite the wave of restrictive voting legislation, my colleague Ezra Klein notes, at least 28 bills expanding voting access have been passed in 14 states.
“We are becoming a two-tiered society when it comes to voting,” Ari Berman, author of “Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America,” told Klein on a recent episode of his podcast. “It’s really easy to vote in some places, namely bluer places. And it’s really hard or getting harder to vote if you live in a red state.”

WHAT YOU’RE SAYING
Here’s what readers had to say about the last debate: How Dangerous Is the Delta Variant?
Rathi: “Most of the article discusses about unvaccinated population, but the real question is about kids who don’t have option of vaccination. How does the Delta variant affect them? What precautions should parents take to protect their kids?”
Kay: “While there are some who haven’t been vaccinated yet due to age, medical condition or lack of access, far too many are apparently too stupid to understand the very probable consequences of any variant of Covid: severe illness or death. ‘Social solidarity’ has such an inclusive ring to it, sort of ‘join the crowd,’ but perhaps we need a starker message: ‘If you’re not vaccinated you will likely get Covid, you may die and you will infect others.’”

Democrats Strain to Halt G.O.P. Voting Restrictions

A speech by President Biden on Tuesday could be a signal of how hard the Democrats will fight to protect voting rights.
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic Party pledged millions for it last week, grass-roots groups are campaigning for it nationwide and, as recently as Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, said the fight for it had only begun. 
  But behind the brave words are rising concerns among voting-rights advocates and Democrats that the counterattack against the aggressive push by Republicans to restrict ballot access is faltering, and at a potentially pivotal moment.
  President Biden is expected to put his political muscle behind the issue in a speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday. But in Congress, Democratic senators have been unable to move voting and election bills that would address what many of them call a fundamental attack on American democracy that could lock in a new era of Republican minority rule.
  And in the courts, attacks on voting restrictions face an increasingly hostile judiciary and narrowing legal options.
  Texas seems poised, absent another walkout by Democratic legislators, to become the latest Republican-controlled state to pass a sweeping legislative agenda placing new barriers to the ability to cast a ballot. That comes on the heels of a major Supreme Court ruling this month further weakening the one enforcement clause of the Voting Rights Act that remained after the court nullified its major provision in 2012. The decision arrived as advocacy groups were pressing lawsuits against restrictive voting laws enacted in roughly a dozen Republican-controlled state legislatures.
  ''One more arrow has been taken out of the quiver of voting-rights plaintiffs to strike down these new laws passed since the 2020 election,'' said Nathaniel Persily, an election-law scholar at Stanford. ''And it's not like they had all that many arrows in the quiver to begin with.''
  Roughly a dozen Republican-controlled states passed laws this past spring restricting voting or significantly changing election rules, ostensibly in response to President Donald J. Trump's false claims that voter fraud cost him the November election. Many made it harder to vote early or by mail, banned or restricted drop boxes, shortened early or absentee voting periods or gave more leeway to partisan poll watchers. Some laws made it easier to replace local election officials with partisans, something voting rights advocates say might make it possible even to invalidate or sway election results.
  Atop that, Republican filibuster threats have bottled up the flagship effort by congressional Democrats to counter such restrictions -- a sweeping overhaul of federal election laws and a beefed-up revision of the Voting Rights Act. Despite controlling the Senate, Democrats have failed to unite behind a change in filibuster rules that would allow them to pass the legislation with a simple majority vote.
  That is a painful reversal for Democrats, who had labeled the bills their top priority, and for Mr. Biden, who said a year ago that strengthening the Voting Rights Act would be his first task in the White House. It also has far-reaching ramifications: The election-overhaul bill would set minimum standards for ballot access, potentially undoing some provisions of the newly enacted laws, and ban gerrymandering just as states begin drawing new boundaries for House seats and local political districts.
  Democrats worry that failing to act will empower states led by Republicans to impose more restrictions before the 2024 presidential election -- a genuine concern, they say, given that Mr. Biden carried the Electoral College by fewer than 43,000 votes in three key states, despite outpolling Mr. Trump by seven million votes nationwide.
  And some worry that a Republican Party that still refuses to accept the legitimacy of the last presidential vote sets the stage for a constitutional crisis should red states, or even a Republican-led House of Representatives, contest the next close election.
  ''There's not a caucus meeting that goes by that our leadership doesn't talk about S. 1 and how our democracy is on the verge of disappearing,'' U.S. Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who has spent 14 years in the House, said in an interview, using shorthand for voting legislation stalled in the Senate. ''There's plenty to be scared about.''
  Republicans argue that it's Democrats who are the threat to democracy. ''The Democratic Party wants to rewrite the ground rules of American politics for partisan benefit,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at a hearing on the bill to overhaul voting laws, called the For the People Act. ''It's hard to imagine anything that would erode public confidence in our democracy more drastically.''
  Mr. McConnell has called the proposal ''a craven political calculation'' that shows ''disdain for the American people.''
  In the states, Republican legislators have frequently taken a similar tack, charging that Democrats oppose tightening voting rules because they benefit from voter fraud.
  More common among voting experts, though, is a view that Republicans, facing unfavorable demographic tides, see their future linked to limiting Democratic turnout.
  ''They're going to do everything they can to hold on to power, and one essential of that is limiting the Democratic vote,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a veteran political analyst and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
  Voting-rights advocates and the Biden administration are not without weapons. Under Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department has already sued to block voting legislation enacted by the Georgia General Assembly this past spring, and more lawsuits are likely.
  On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris said that the Democratic National Committee planned to spend $25 million before the 2022 midterms to organize and educate voters.
  And a number of voting rights advocates said they believed that the breadth and the audacity of Republican voting restrictions was igniting a backlash that would power a grass-roots voting movement and increase Democratic turnout in the midterms.
  ''It could well have a significant pushback,'' said Miles Rapoport, a senior fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance at Harvard. ''The extra motivation of 'You're not going to take away my vote' could end up with very, very heavy turnout come 2022 and 2024.''
  But voting issues could be a motivator for both parties and, in a highly polarized electorate, the moral high ground can be hard to establish.
  ''I think a lot of this from the other side is political theater,'' Representative Briscoe Cain, the Republican House Elections Committee chairman in Texas said in a phone interview on Sunday night. The goal, he said, is to ''win elections and make Republicans look bad.''
  Advocacy groups and Democrats also are in the courts. In Georgia alone, eight lawsuits are challenging Republican election laws enacted in the spring. Marc Elias, a longtime lawyer for Democratic Party interests, is opposing new election laws in seven Republican-dominated states.
  How badly the Supreme Court ruling will hinder such efforts is unclear. The 6-to-3 decision, covering Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, made it much harder to attack a voting restriction based principally on its lopsided impact on a minority group.
  Mr. Elias called the ruling ''a terrible decision,'' but added that most election lawsuits claim violations of the Constitution, not the Voting Rights Act.
  Richard L. Hasen, a leading election-law expert at the University of California, Irvine, was less sanguine, arguing that one part of the ruling has given states wide latitude to defend restrictions as necessary to prevent fraud -- even if there is no evidence of fraud. Stopping fraud is by far the leading reason cited by Republican legislators sponsoring curbs on voting.
  ''There's no question that the road is much tougher for voting rights plaintiffs in federal courts,'' he said. ''These battles will have to be fought within each state, mustering coalitions among business groups, civil leaders and voters from all parties who care about the sanctity of the right to vote.''
  Legal options also exist outside the federal judiciary. Mr. Elias recently won a suit claiming discrimination against college-age voters in the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The Southern Coalition for Social Justice is challenging North Carolina's voter ID requirements in that state's Supreme Court.
  And Alison Riggs, a voting-rights lawyer and co-executive director of the coalition, noted that Congress could easily address concerns with the court's ruling in any revision of the Voting Rights Act.
  Mr. Biden's speech on Tuesday may signal whether he intends to become involved in pushing that legislation and the overhaul of voting laws to passage.
  Mr. Biden made voting issues a priority in his campaign, but as president he has emphasized bread-and-butter issues like infrastructure spending and coronavirus relief. He was largely absent in June when Democrats in the Senate tried and failed to bring up the For the People Act for debate -- in part, perhaps, because even Democrats realized that it must be stripped down to a more basic bill to have a chance of passing.
  The president is unlikely to have that option again. Over the weekend, a close ally, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, told Politico that Mr. Biden must push to modify the filibuster so both voting bills could pass.
  So did civil rights leaders in a meeting with the president on Thursday. ''We will not be able to litigate our way out of this threat to Black citizenship, voting and political participation,'' Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said later. ''We need legislation to be passed in Congress.''
  The consequences of doing that -- or not -- could be profound, said Dr. Sabato.
  ''If there was ever a moment to act, it would be now, because Republican legislatures with Republican governors are going to go even further as we move into the future,'' he said.
  ''For years, Democrats will point to this as a missed moment. And they'll be right.''

Senators heard testimony from Georgians affected by a restrictive new voting law signed by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. Their real aim was to sway a debate in Washington.
ATLANTA -- Senate Democrats took their faltering push for a federal voting rights law on the road to Georgia on Monday, seeking to make the case for an elections overhaul in Congress from a state at the heart of a national battle with Republicans over access to the ballot. 
  At a field hearing at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights here, state lawmakers and voters warned the Senate Rules Committee that Georgia's restrictive, newly enacted voting law was slowly undoing decades of hard-won progress. Casting the measure as a deliberate attempt by Republicans to disenfranchise Black voters, cause chaos at the ballot box and consolidate their tenuous grip on power, they demanded that Congress intervene.
  ''There is much talk about not being able to give food and water to voters on line, but the actual law is much more abhorrent than that,'' Representative Billy Mitchell, the chairman of Georgia's House Democratic Caucus, told the panel. ''What I am most concerned about -- and hope you come up with a solution for -- is cheating umpires that these laws are creating.''
  Senate Democrats said they were hopeful that the change of scenery would provide a fresh spurt of momentum to their campaign to pass a bill that would put in place a federal floor for ballot access nationwide, effectively nullifying many of the changes adopted in Georgia and several other states. But there was little sign that would be the case, given that Republicans have blocked that legislation and they lack the support to eliminate the 60-vote threshold to break a filibuster.
  Though senators have locked arms with voting rights activists and huddled last week in the Capitol with Texas state lawmakers, Monday was the first time they had tried to shine an on-the-ground light on one of more than a dozen states that have adopted voting restrictions.
  ''If you just stay in Washington and get doused down and gridlocked out by our archaic procedures in the Senate, you lose sight of what you are fighting for,'' said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who led the hearing.
  Still, it seemed unlikely that the session would make a meaningful impact on the legislative debate 500 miles away in Washington, where Republicans dismissed the hearing as a stunt and boycotted it.
  An initial attempt by Democrats to debate their overhaul, the For the People Act, failed in the Senate last month in the face of unified Republican opposition. The legislation would have mandated automatic voter registration, and early and no-excuse mail-in voting nationwide; ended partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts; and put new requirements on super PACs to disclose their big donors.
  Now Democrats are trying to retool. The stakes are high. As Republican states race ahead with new laws, Democrats have been unable to find a way around Republican opposition in the Senate or deliver on promises of success. Voting rights activists are growing impatient for progress and warning that if Congress fails to act by early fall, it could be too late for its changes to take effect before the 2022 elections.
  Party leaders are working with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the most outspoken Democratic opponent of the measure, to draft a narrower compromise bill, which could come up for another vote in August or the fall.
  They are also preparing additional legislation, named after the civil rights icon John Lewis of Georgia, to strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And Ms. Klobuchar detailed a separate effort to use the party's $3.5 trillion budget blueprint to incentivize states to expand ballot access through federal grants. That approach would allow Democrats to go around Republican objections using special budgetary rules, but it would not allow Congress to actually mandate that states take any action.
  But the real fight is over persuading Mr. Manchin and a handful of other holdouts to support changes to the filibuster, allowing Democrats to move voting rights legislation despite Republican objections.
  ''I'm doing everything I know how,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat and the highest-ranking Black lawmaker in Congress.
  In an interview, Mr. Clyburn said he had made his views on the need for a filibuster carve out plain to the White House and had another ''long talk'' last week with Mr. Manchin about the West Virginian's concerns about proceeding unilaterally -- without luck.
  ''Joe Manchin is really trying to find a place to maintain the integrity of the filibuster, which I'm not with him on,'' Mr. Clyburn said in an interview. ''I know the history of the filibuster; I intend not to ignore history. It has been used primarily -- almost exclusively -- to deny civil rights like voting.''
  Democrats, he added, ''could be relegating ourselves to the dustbin of history as a party'' if they fail to take action during this Congress on the matter.
  In Atlanta on Monday, Georgia Democrats issued similarly dire warnings.
  Testifying in front of black-and-white photos of the civil rights movement, Helen Butler told senators about how she and another Black election official in Morgan County had been removed from the county elections board at the beginning of the month after a new law gave Republicans the power to appoint its members.
  The changes, she said, ''raised the specter that the goal would be to nullify the lawful vote of Georgia voters when the majority party is not satisfied with the outcome of the election, thereby achieving an outcome the former president was not able to in 2020.''
  Adopted in April, the Georgia law put new ID requirements on absentee ballots, limited the number of drop boxes where voters could deposit them, outlawed third parties from giving food or water to voters waiting in line, and effectively granted the Republican-led legislature new power to overrule state and county elections officials and sway the outcome of an election.
  Later, Ms. Butler, who has spent decades helping Black Georgians vote as the director of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, said she worried about how fellow voters of color would navigate a tangle of new rules and requirements.
  ''They may be able to get over the hurdles, but my God, what kind of barriers will they have to get through?'' she said.
  José Segarra, a former Air Force pilot from rural Houston County, told senators that he had done just that in 2020, standing in lines so long that some voters simply had to leave to go to work or care for children before they had the chance to cast a ballot.
  ''After an hour and half standing outside, we made it inside the building finally -- just to find out the line inside the building was just as long,'' Mr. Segarra said. ''Senators, this is wrong. It should not take so long to vote.''
  Republicans on the Rules Committee did not invite any members of their party to defend the law, calling the hearing a disingenuous ploy.
  ''This silly stunt is based on the same lie as all the Democrats' phony hysteria from Georgia to Texas to Washington, D.C., and beyond -- their efforts to pretend that moderate, mainstream state voting laws with more generous early voting provisions than blue states like New York are some kind of evil assault on our democracy,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said in a statement.
  In a video posted to his Twitter account just after the hearing concluded, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, defended his state's new elections law as ''common sense reforms.'' He accused Democrats of conducting ''bogus hearings to try to demonize election integrity laws'' and raise money.
  The Justice Department sued the state last month over the statute, which the Biden administration argued discriminated against Black voters in violation of the law.

Covid Quarantine Stalls Texas Democrats' Fight for Voting Rights

After at least six state lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus, the group is now confined to a Washington hotel, holding virtual meetings and making little headway in its persuasion campaign.
WASHINGTON -- Democratic state lawmakers from Texas arrived in Washington last week with plans to apply unending pressure on the Senate to pass voting rights protections that would help counteract a Republican election overhaul bill back home. 
  Then a Covid-19 outbreak stalled their progress.
  The entire delegation from Texas is now stuck at a Washington hotel after six of the Democratic state representatives tested positive for the coronavirus, and an official from Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office who met with them has also tested positive. All of those who have tested positive are fully vaccinated, but nobody in the capital is now particularly eager to meet in person with the group, which has resorted to virtual meetings.
  In the meantime, Senate Democratic leaders remain focused on passing an infrastructure package, President Biden is in a standoff with social media companies, and there has been no public sign that the Texas Democrats have won over any senators who weren't already on board with their push to pass new federal voting legislation without clearing a 60-vote Senate threshold. They have not secured a group meeting with Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona or with any Republicans. (A state senator, who is not part of the group of House Democrats who first left Texas, did meet with Ms. Sinema, the senator's office said.)
  And they cannot go home to Texas for another two and a half weeks or they will risk being arrested for leaving the state.
  The lawmakers' journey began last week when nearly 60 Democratic members of the State House departed Texas in an effort to prevent the passage of a restrictive new voting bill by the Republican-controlled Legislature. After their arrival in Washington was met with a swarm of television cameras in an airport parking lot, subsequent efforts to draw attention to their cause were less successful.
  Now, with the coronavirus appearing to spread among the lawmakers, plans for larger events like a Washington gathering of supportive state legislators from across the country have been delayed.
  ''If anything, this goes into a low gear, but I think the momentum still builds and we're in a perfect position when this thing crescendos,'' said State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a leader of the delegation who on Tuesday was in the third day of a 10-day quarantine in his hotel room after testing positive for the virus. ''It's slowed things down a little bit, but this Covid is not unique to us. It may just change our engagement methods, but we still have a way to make a splash.''
  The outbreak, which began on Saturday with three positive tests among the Texas lawmakers, has now spread beyond the group. A press aide for Ms. Pelosi tested positive on Monday after coming into contact with members of the Texas Legislature last week, said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for the speaker.
  He said the aide had had no contact with the speaker since being exposed to the virus. Mr. Hammill added that Ms. Pelosi's press office was working remotely, except for aides who had tested negative or who did not come in contact with the infected aide.
  Also on Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference that a fully vaccinated White House official had also tested positive for the virus ''off campus,'' was experiencing ''mild symptoms,'' and remained away from the complex awaiting a test to confirm the diagnosis. She would not divulge whether the aide had been with the Texas lawmakers.
  The news of the infections rattled some on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers and their aides have been moving toward more normal operations for months. 
  By staying away from the State Capitol in Austin, the Democratic state representatives have denied Republicans a quorum necessary for the State House to conduct business, delaying the passage of new restrictions on voting. Those voting measures, along with other conservative priorities, were put forward in a special session that was called only because the State House Democrats walked out of the Capitol in the final hours of the regular session in May, denying Republicans an opportunity to pass a voting bill then.
  Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has threatened to have Texas House Democrats who return to the state arrested and ''cabined'' in the State House chamber until a quorum is reached.
  Mr. Abbott and other Texas Republicans have relentlessly mocked the Democrats. Dade Phelan, the Republican speaker of the Texas State House, has demanded they return their $221 per diem, said he had chartered a plane from Washington to pick them up, and said he had consulted with the state health commissioner ''for any additional guidance on protocols for those exposed to Covid-19 post-vaccination.''
  The Texas Democrats, who are all said to be vaccinated, did not wear masks on their two charter flights from Austin to the Washington area, nor did they on buses to and from the airports.
  Because of the outbreak, meetings and conferences that would have taken place in person are now on screens. Plans for at least the next week have been frozen.
  ''Everybody is scrambling because the realization is hitting that this new strain is among us and is very contagious even among people who are vaccinated,'' Gina Hinojosa, a state representative from Austin, said.
  On Tuesday morning, the delegation met over a video call with Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat. Mr. Clyburn, Ms. Hinojosa said, remains optimistic that the Senate can pass a federal voting rights overhaul before early August, when the current special session of the Texas Legislature will expire. (Mr. Abbott has promised to call a new one if Democrats do not return by Aug. 6, when the session ends.)
  Mr. Clyburn encouraged the Texans, they said, to push to have a key measure in the proposed John Lewis Voting Rights Act -- the Justice Department's preclearance requirements, under which a number of states mostly in the South had to receive federal approval before changing voting laws -- transferred to the more comprehensive For the People Act, which passed the House and remains stalled in the Senate.
  A representative for Mr. Clyburn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  Later on Tuesday, the Texas Democratic delegation, whose members are now undergoing daily virus tests, hosted a virtual news conference, reiterating the long history of civil rights and voting rights battles and reaffirming their commitment to push Congress and the White House to pass federal voting legislation.
  But the members were confined to pixelated Zoom boxes, and some of them simply had avatars appear when they spoke, or black boxes with their names half obscured.
  ''We have a very robust agenda in terms of continued outreach to members of Congress,'' said State Representative Ron Reynolds, who represents the Houston area. ''We're still working diligently through the Covid protocols that we've already set in place.''
  He added: ''We're not doing as many in-person visits. We're still having many meetings via Zoom.''
  The members also said they remained hopeful for a meeting with Mr. Biden; while they met with Vice President Kamala Harris on their first full day in Washington, they have yet to secure a meeting with the president.
  ''We know the president is watching,'' said State Representative Ina Minjarez, who is from San Antonio. ''We're waiting for him to call.''

His arrest comes one week after that of Representative Joyce Beatty by U.S. Capitol Police. Both Democrats were demonstrating for voting rights.
Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, was among a group of protesters arrested on the Capitol complex on Thursday while demonstrating for voting rights and against the filibuster in the Senate. The arrest came one week after the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus was arrested by U.S. Capitol Police, also while demonstrating for voting rights.
“I was arrested today protesting against Senate inaction on voting rights legislation &amp; filibuster reform,” Mr. Johnson wrote on Twitter. “In the spirit of my dear friend and mentor — the late Congressman John Lewis — I was getting in #goodtrouble.”
In a video posted to his Twitter account, Mr. Johnson could be seen continuing to chant with protesters even after he was taken into custody with his hands bound in zip ties.
Tia Mitchell, a reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution who was on the scene, posted a video on Twitter showing Mr. Johnson and other protesters with their arms linked, blocking a doorway. They were warned by U.S. Capitol Police that they could be arrested for demonstrating without a permit, according to Ms. Mitchell.
Last Thursday, Representative Joyce Beatty, Democrat of Ohio, was among nine people arrested in the atrium of a Senate office building while demonstrating in favor of two voting rights bills in Congress, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act.
Both measures aim to protect and expand access to voting but face long odds of becoming law because Democrats, who have a narrow majority in the Senate, need Republican votes to overcome a filibuster. For months, Democrats have expressed frustration over their inability to advance their expansive voting overhauls as Republican state legislatures rush to pass laws that restrict voting rights across the country.
President Biden last week called the fight against restrictive voting laws the “most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War,” even as he seemed to acknowledge that the legislation had little hope of passing. At a televised town hall on Wednesday in Cincinnati, the president defended keeping the filibuster, saying that getting rid of it would “throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done.”
As news and images of the arrests spread across social media, some noted the contrast between the treatment of the members of Congress, who are both Black, and the hundreds of rioters who trespassed at the Capitol on Jan. 6 who were not detained, although police made efforts to impede them.
In an interview with Elle about her arrest, Ms. Beatty pointed out the same discrepancy.
“At the Jan. 6 insurrection, you had thousands of people damaging federal property, rushing and breaking down doors,” Ms. Beatty said. “People were dying. There was nothing peaceful about it. And look what happened. That day there were no arrests, no handcuffs, no paddy wagons.”

Why Democrats in Texas Fled Vote on Ballot Bill, And What Awaits Them

The Democratic legislators who fled to Washington to thwart the passage of a restrictive voting measure cannot be legally forced to return from out of state.
SAN ANTONIO -- When Texas Democrats walked out of the Statehouse in late May, denying Republicans a quorum and thwarting passage of a restrictive voting measure, it was a dramatic political move not seen in nearly two decades. 
  They did it again this week, this time fleeing the state for Washington shortly after a 30-day special session to secure passage of the bill commenced. The bill includes restrictions on absentee voting and bans 24-hour and drive-through voting, which drew millions of voters in Democratic strongholds across the state in November.
  Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed that the Democrats who absconded will face reprimands, telling Fox News, ''Once they step back into the state, they will be arrested and brought back to the Capitol and we will be conducting business.''
  On Tuesday, the Texas House voted to issue arrest warrants to compel the lawmakers to return to Austin.
  Democrats, so far, have not budged. Those who flew on chartered planes to Washington signaled that they would remain there until the special session concludes. Still, what does their absence mean? And what happens next?
  Can Republicans compel Democrats to return?
  In short, no.
  The Democrats who fled cannot be legally forced to return from out of state. While Mr. Abbott can ask the federal government or attorneys general from outside Texas to issue orders of arrests, those who absconded are unlikely to cooperate, political experts said.
  If they were in the state, the legislative body could request their presence, experts said. And the state police and Texas Rangers would then have the power to arrest them and return them to the Capitol grounds. But that is ''less likely to occur if they are in Washington,'' said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University.
  Still, the Democrats have to eventually return home, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. ''They have jobs, they have lives, they have families.''
  Once they are back in the state, lawmakers can pass resolutions to fine the Democrats for every day they were gone, and they could also take away privileges, such as parking spaces, Mr. Rottinghaus said.
  The Republican majority can also potentially censure Democrats and strip them of committee assignments. But after the Democrats fled in similar fashion in 2003, their Republican colleagues did not move to punish them once the session resumed. ''It was forgive and forget,'' Mr. Rottinghaus said.
  In the end, the Republican lawmakers ''are going to get what they want,'' he added. ''It's going to take a little longer.''
  What is the Democrats' plan?
  When the Democrats do finally return, they are unlikely to win the fight over voting legislation. Not only does Mr. Abbott have the power to call for as many special sessions as he wants, but the Republicans, who hold firm majorities in both chambers, are sure to move their agenda forward.
  That agenda includes more than the voting restrictions, which would be among the strictest in the nation. The state's Republicans also want to combat perceived ''censorship'' on social media platforms and restrict transgender athletes from competing in school sports on teams that match their gender identity.
  For the Democrats, political observers say, fleeing the state on Monday was more about taking a political stand than bringing Republicans around to their way of thinking.
  Julián Castro, a Democrat who was President Barack Obama's housing secretary and a former mayor of San Antonio, said the party's best bet at this point is to push congressional Democrats to pass national voting laws that would do away with many of the restrictions being considered in Austin. Congress is locked in a fight over the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, both of which would seek to strengthen voting protections nationwide.
  ''What I see coming next for them is to continue to be high-profile and put pressure on Washington for federal legislation,'' Mr. Castro said. ''I'm convinced they'll stay as long as they need to.''
  Is running away here to stay?
  Dade Phelan, the speaker of the Texas House, could have directed the sergeant-at-arms to guard entrances and exits to prevent the mass exodus of Democrats. But it was unlikely that he expected lawmakers from the opposing party to flee for the second time in a little more than a month, political experts said.
  ''I was actually surprised that Democrats got away with it, the way that they did,'' Mr. Rottinghaus said. ''Once it happens, the baby's been born.''
  Is running away the last resort for Democrats, who are outnumbered in both chambers? And is it a tactic they will continue to use?
  ''The Democrats are drawing a line in the sand,'' he said, adding: ''They don't have any other options on the table. They are literally and symbolically fleeing to Washington to get help from national Democrats.''
  Mr. Jones said tactics like breaking quorum in such spectacular fashion might bring national attention and help Democrats raise millions of dollars. But the move will ultimately do little to affect legislation.
  ''The governor in Texas can call as many special sessions as he wants,'' Mr. Jones said.
  The Republicans may also have few options to prevent similar tactics in the future. They need significant Democratic buy-in to change quorum rules in the Texas Constitution. But ''you might see payback'' in the next regular legislative session, Mr. Jones said. ''You might see a lot fewer Democrats in committee chairmanships.''
  What does the current voting bill include?
  It has been a challenging year for Democrats in state legislatures across the country. More than 14 Republican-controlled states have passed sweeping election laws that restrict voting access in ways that could hurt Democrats.
  In Texas, a state that already ranks as one of the most difficult in which to cast a ballot, Republicans held marathon sessions regarding the voting bill in the last few days of the regular session that ended in late May.
  The legislation includes provisions that would ban 24-hour voting and drive-through voting; greatly expand the authority and autonomy of partisan poll watchers; limit third-party ballot collection; increase the criminal penalties for election workers who run afoul of regulations; and add new voter identification requirements for voting by mail.
  Is fleeing the state a new tactic?
  This week was not the first time Texas legislators in the minority party fled in an attempt to block passage of controversial legislation. In May 2003, more than 50 House Democrats escaped to Ardmore, Okla., 30 miles north of the Texas border, to block Republicans from redrawing congressional districts.
  The measure failed without a quorum.
  Two months later, after the governor at the time, Rick Perry, called a special session, 11 Democratic state senators fled to New Mexico, a 640-mile trip from Austin, to again deny their Republican colleagues a quorum and stave off redistricting efforts that they believed would hurt their party.
  Most notably, in 1979, a dozen Democratic senators known as the ''Killer Bees'' hid for five days from the Republicans and Texas Rangers to prevent the Senate from reaching a quorum.
  They had been objecting to a bill that aimed to create two primaries, one for the presidential race and one for a general primary, which they described at the time as a measure that was likely to favor the candidacy of John B. Connally, the former Texas governor who was up for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980. That bill later died in the Senate.

Texas Democrats Discussing Voting Rights With Senators

State lawmakers from Texas said they had met with senators like Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren as they try to pressure Congress to pass federal voting legislation.
Day 2 of the Texas Democrats' campaign in Washington to pressure Congress to enact federal voting rights protections was much like the first: packed with meetings with supportive senators, cable television appearances and a news conference. 
  This time, it was Democratic state senators who stood before cameras on Wednesday inside a conference room at a Washington hotel -- the event was moved indoors from outside the Capitol to avoid the midday heat -- to reiterate their pledge to remain outside Texas until the state's special legislative session expires next month.
  The contingent of reporters who gathered for the event was far smaller than the press corps that congregated outside the Capitol a day earlier to see Texas state representatives at their first appearance in Washington.
  The Democratic state senators echoed their State House colleagues, who have blocked Republicans from doing business by denying a quorum to operate, in arguing that they were in Washington on a working trip, not a vacation, as Republicans have portrayed the trip. The State House Democrats came to Washington in an effort to stop Republicans from enacting new restrictions to voting laws in Texas; the party's state senators failed to deny a quorum in that chamber because four of their colleagues stayed in Austin.
  ''We're not fleeing,'' said State Senator Royce West, one of the lawmakers who spoke in Washington. ''We're working here today.''
  State Senator Carol Alvarado, the chairwoman of the Texas State Senate Democratic Caucus, said that the group had a ''very intimate'' meeting on Tuesday afternoon with Vice President Kamala Harris. Other members of the group mentioned that they had met with sympathetic Democratic senators like Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
  A delegation of Texas Democrats has a meeting scheduled for Thursday with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the first session they will have with a senator who has not already committed to passing Democrats' major federal voting rights bills with a simple majority rather than requiring a 60-vote threshold. One of the bills, the For the People Act, would create sweeping new federal protections for voting, while a narrower bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would restore key parts of the Voting Rights Act that were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.
  State Representative Chris Turner, the chairman of the Texas House Democratic caucus, said he was trying to organize meetings with Republican senators and other Democratic senators who have not committed to bypassing the 60-vote threshold to enact federal voting rights legislation.
  There is no indication any Senate Republicans are sympathetic to the Texans' arguments. And on Wednesday morning, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, excoriated the state Democrats who fled.
  ''They've just come here to Washington to snap selfies, bask in the limelight and beg Senate Democrats to take over Texas elections,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''This outrage is completely phony.''
  In Texas, Dade Phelan, the speaker of the State House, asked Democrats who left Austin to return their $221 per diem, and the State Senate, which remains in session, passed a series of bills on bail bond reform, property tax cuts and social media regulations.
  ''The Senate is going to keep passing bills,'' said State Senator Bryan Hughes, the chief architect of the Senate elections bill. ''All those elements the governor put on the special session are important to folks back home, so we're going to get them passed.''
  Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that she did not have any details on a legislative strategy for passing the Democrats' federal voting rights bills.

It was the second time in six weeks that Texas Democrats have staged a walkout to try to prevent passage of a sweeping election overhaul bill.
WASHINGTON -- For many Democrats in the Texas House, the decision to leave the state on Monday to temporarily block the passage of a restrictive voting law upended a lot of plans, but few more so than Representative Celia Israel, who postponed her wedding. 
  After learning a day earlier that 50 of her colleagues were rushing ahead with an 11th-hour trip to Washington to deny Republicans a quorum, which is required to conduct state business, Ms. Israel called off the ceremony in a matter of hours.
  ''It wasn't a fun day when I had to tell my partner, Sunday, as she's getting measured by a seamstress for her wedding outfit, that we were about to break quorum,'' she said.
  The bid by Democratic lawmakers was the second time in six weeks they have staged a walkout to try to prevent passage of a sweeping election overhaul bill. In May, Democrats departed the Capitol chamber for a nearby church, prompting Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special session last week. Mr. Abbott and state Republicans aimed to pass the legislation in the current session along with other bills concerning transgender rights and the banning of ''critical race theory'' in public schools.
  Ms. Israel said that she and her partner had delayed their wedding, which was to take place on the Texas House floor on Thursday, years after the Supreme Court upheld same-sex marriage in 2015 so that they could hold the ceremony in their home state. The pair had planned a quintessentially Texas wedding, with a bachelorette party in Austin on Wednesday and a celebration at a country music festival in Marathon this weekend.
  ''My partner and I have been together 26 years, and we're Texas girls,'' Ms. Israel said. ''We could have flown to Hawaii and got married when it was legal, but we said, 'No, we're Texans.'''
  Ms. Israel said that she intended to reschedule, but that the exact date was up in the air. Representative Donna Howard, her colleague in the House whom Ms. Israel had asked to officiate, is also among the delegation of Democrats who departed Austin on a pair of chartered flights on Monday.
  In a statement posted on Twitter on Monday, Mr. Abbott accused Democrats of abdicating their duties as legislators and dismissed the effort to stall the voting bill as political theater.
  ''Texas Democrats' decision to break a quorum of the Texas Legislature and abandon the Texas State Capitol inflicts harm on the very Texans who elected them to serve,'' he said. ''As they fly across the country on cushy private planes, they leave undone issues that can help their districts and our state.''
  But many of those who made the trip insisted that the move was critical given that other states had passed similarly strict measures.
  In particular, Democrats vowed to prevent the House from taking up the legislation by, if necessary, remaining outside Texas until the special session ends on Aug. 6, forcing some to make hasty departure plans and redraw their personal schedules for four weeks. Texas Republicans this week expressed defiance, saying that even if the legislation is held up this session, it will be taken up again in a future one.
  State Representative Erin Zwiener, who helped plan Democrats' exodus, said she and her husband decided that their 3-year-old daughter would accompany her on her chartered flight to Washington.
  ''I ended up bringing 200-piece puzzles and some Legos to try and make sure she'd have something to do in the hotel room,'' she said.
  Ms. Zwiener said that the decision would allow her husband to work without making last-minute child care arrangements, and that he would be able to visit without having to take their daughter, who is too young to be vaccinated against Covid-19, on a commercial airline.
  ''It was the option that guaranteed I'd see my kid in the next month,'' she said.
  As the delegation assembled to rally opposition against the voting bill in Washington on Tuesday, in Austin, remaining House members voted to send law enforcement to track down their colleagues and return them to Texas ''under warrant of arrest, if necessary.''
  Acknowledging that their efforts only briefly forestall the voting legislation in Texas, Democrats have increasingly turned to Washington for help. At the invitation of Democratic leaders, members traveled to the capital last month to make an appeal for the comprehensive voting rights measure called the For the People Act.
  Absent major action from Congress, the departure of Texas Democrats has so far amounted to little more than the latest chapter in the struggle between Republicans and Democrats over the future of voting in Texas.
  But many who made the trip described the bid as one of their responsibilities.
  ''It's how strongly I feel about my job,'' Ms. Israel said, ''and how strongly I feel about this moment in time and history, to stand up strong, not just for Texas but for the whole country.''

Democratic Legislators Flee Texas in Voting Fight

The move is an attempt to block Republicans from passing a new voting bill while also applying pressure on Congress to pass legislation at the federal level.
STERLING, Va. -- Texas Democrats fled the state on Monday in a last-ditch effort to prevent the passage of a restrictive new voting law by the Republican-controlled Legislature, heading to Washington to draw national attention to their cause.  
  The group left Austin in midafternoon on a pair of chartered flights that arrived at Dulles International Airport just before sunset. Fifty-one of the 67 State House Democrats flew on the planes, leaders of the delegation said, and several others arrived separately in Washington; that's enough to prevent Texas Republicans from attaining a quorum, which is required to conduct state business. 
  The hastily arranged departure added a cinematic element to the partisan wrangling in a state with a colorful political history. Democrats have fled to neighboring states in the past to try to block legislation, including in 2003, when they traveled to New Mexico and Oklahoma in an effort to avoid Republican attempts to redraw congressional districts. 
  The move could paralyze the Legislature for weeks if Democrats remain out of state until this special session ends in August. Still, it lays bare their limited options long-term in a Legislature where the Republicans hold the majority in both chambers. Parliamentary procedures and efforts to add amendments can delay the process but not derail it. Republicans said Monday the Democrats' gambit would ultimately fail. 
  ''It's just delaying the inevitable,'' said State Representative Briscoe Cain, a Houston-area Republican who chairs the House Elections Committee. He described the move as ''political theater.'' 
  ''We will eventually get it done, this special or another,'' he added.
  Nevertheless, by traveling en masse to Washington, the Texas Democrats were hoping to apply pressure to Democrats in the U.S. Senate who so far have been unable to pass federal legislation to address the issue. 
  ''We have to decide if we are going to stand for democracy,'' said State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, who organized the effort to leave the state. ''We want the nation to join us and we want the U.S. Senate to hear us and act.'' 
  The move comes just one day before President Biden is scheduled to deliver a major speech on voting rights in Philadelphia. Activists have been imploring the administration to address the issue with more urgency. 
  In a news conference at the White House on Monday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Biden would focus his speech on a broad and pointed response to new restrictive voting legislation passed across the country. The recently passed Republican-sponsored voting laws, Ms. Psaki said, were ''the worst challenge to our democracy since the Civil War.''
  On Monday night, members of the Texas delegation reiterated their resolve in a 15-minute news conference from an airport parking lot, which concluded with members singing the chorus of ''We Shall Overcome.''  
  The group has scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Capitol, but has no concrete plans in Washington beyond that. 
  The flight by House Democrats marks the second time in six weeks they have resorted to extreme measures to try to prevent passage of a new voting bill. Hours before the  Legislature's regularly planned session ended in May, Democrats walked out of the Capitol chamber to deny Republicans a quorum, though in that instance they traveled only a few miles to a nearby church.
  Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, responded to the initial walkout by calling a 30-day special session that began Thursday. Along with the voting proposals, the governor called for the Legislature to take up other measures Democratic lawmakers oppose: combating perceived ''censorship'' on social media platforms; banning the teaching of ''critical race theory'' in public schools; and restricting transgender athletes from competing in school sports.
  Leading Democrats on Monday praised the Texas lawmakers for making a stand on a critical issue. ''I applaud them standing for the rights of all Americans and all Texans to express their voice through their vote unencumbered,'' Vice President Kamala Harris said at an event in Detroit. 
  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who chaperoned a group of Texas House Democrats when they visited the Capitol after their first walkout, said the Texans' arrival will spotlight the ''many vehicles'' in which to pass federal voting reforms.  
  ''They are coming to the one place that should give them salvation and it's time to get it done,'' she said in a phone interview. 
  But Texas Republicans suggested that Democrats were abdicating their responsibilities by leaving the state.
  Tony Tinderholt, a conservative Republican from Arlington, said the Democratic lawmakers ''should be held accountable'' if they are not back at their seats when the House resumes work at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. Mr. Tinderholt has introduced a resolution that would punish members who leave the chamber during deliberations to break a quorum. 
  ''We all took an oath of office, we have a duty,'' he said. ''If you work for a company and you didn't like what they were doing that day and you decided to skip work. I think that most people would be fired and punished.''
  Dade Phelan, the Republican speaker of the state House, pledged to employ ''every available resource'' to secure a quorum, suggesting he would use lawyers and legal experts to hunt for options under the state constitution and House rules. He rebuked Democrats for leaving while the Legislature's funding -- which Mr. Abbott vetoed and was on the docket for the special session -- remains in limbo. 
  And Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor, mocked the Democrats by tweeting a photo that showed them preparing to travel with a case of beer on one of the seats. 
  No Democratic State Senate members accompanied the  House members, and Republicans expressed hope that Senate members would show up for Tuesday's session, though no bill can pass with the approval of only one chamber. One Texas Democratic official said that as many as nine of 13 Democrats in the State Senate could join them in Washington on Tuesday, but that is two short of the number required to prevent a quorum.
  State Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston, said that he expects his chamber to take up the voting legislation Tuesday. 
  ''Senate Democrats are keeping all their options open,'' Mr. Whitmire said. ''I don't know that a consensus has been built.'' 
  Over the past several months, Democrats across the country have been grappling with one of the most sweeping contractions of voting access in generations. Republican-controlled legislatures in more than 14 states have passed election laws that include broad new restrictions to voting. 
  But the bill in Texas is among the most expansive and sweeping efforts to restrict voting in a state that already ranks as one of the most difficult in the country to cast a ballot, with Democrats and voting rights groups contending that passage of the bill threatens the very democratic foundations of the state.
  Among other provisions, the latest Republican proposal would ban 24-hour voting and drive-through voting; add new voter identification requirements for voting by mail; increase the criminal penalties for election workers who run afoul of regulations; and greatly expand the authority and autonomy of partisan poll watchers.
  Over the weekend, the Texas House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, advanced legislation out of committee to the full chamber, after marathon sessions that, in the case of the House, lasted nearly 24 hours. G.O.P. leaders planned to move toward a final vote starting Tuesday. 
  Mr. Abbott, the governor, is up for re-election next year and faces primary challenges from multiple conservative Republican.  He has said that overhauling the state's electoral system is one of his top priorities. 
  On Monday, Mr. Abbott said the flight by Democratic House members from Texas ''inflicts harm on the very Texans who elected them to serve'' and called on the members to ''get back to the job they were elected to do.''
  If Democrats remain out of state and deny a quorum until the special session concludes at the end of the month, Mr. Abbott can simply call another one. He is certain to call at least one more session later this year to pass new congressional and legislative maps and allocate billions of dollars in federal pandemic relief funding.
  Texas Democrats used their temporary victory in May to draw attention to their efforts to block new Republican voting laws and the debate in the U.S. Senate over whether to pass federal protections for voters. They traveled to Washington to lobby senators at the Capitol and met with Ms. Harris at the White House. 
  But efforts by congressional Democrats to pass a sweeping new voting law, the For the People Act, stalled last month when Republicans blocked it in the Senate.
  The Texas Democrats' escape follows several days of internal deliberations about how aggressively to resist the Republican proposals on voting. While a group of progressive young lawmakers advocated leaving the state, the party's leadership had been more cautious, pushing a plan to force a series of votes on amendments aimed at watering down the voting bill.
  Democratic reluctance to fleeing the state evaporated over the weekend as liberal activists, Texas citizens and Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman who is the state party's most popular figure, testified at a hearing beginning Saturday morning that lasted nearly 24 hours. 
  By late Sunday afternoon there was sufficient momentum toward leaving that Democratic leaders who had privately warned against doing so came on board with the plan.
  ''We need them to act now because they will keep calling these special sessions to pass voter suppression legislation,'' Chris Turner, the Democratic caucus chairman, said when the group arrived at Dulles. ''So we need Congress to act now. The clock is ticking, they've got to act before the August recess.''

Representative Joyce Beatty said she was protesting “in defense of our constitutional right to vote” when she was detained by the U.S. Capitol Police.
The chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Joyce Beatty, was arrested on Thursday on Capitol Hill along with eight activists who were demonstrating for voting rights.
“You can arrest me. You can’t stop me. You can’t silence me,” Ms. Beatty, an Ohio Democrat, wrote in a tweet after her arrest by the U.S. Capitol Police in the atrium of a Senate office building. A reporter on the scene noted on Twitter that her hands had been bound with zip ties before she was led away.
The Capitol Police said in a statement that the protesters had violated a Washington law against crowding or blocking streets or certain spaces in public buildings. The protesters were warned before they were detained, the police said.
Ms. Beatty and a group of activists were protesting the languishing of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act in Congress. The two bills aim in part to protect and expand access to voting, but both are facing long odds of becoming law.
Democrats, who have narrow congressional majorities and need Republican votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, have expressed frustration for months over their inability to pass their expansive voting overhauls as Republican state legislatures rush to pass laws that restrict voting rights across the country.
President Biden this week called the fight against restrictive voting laws the “most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War,” even as he seemed to acknowledge that the legislation had little hope of passing.
In a statement after her arrest, Ms. Beatty remained defiant.
“I stand in solidarity with Black women and allies across the country in defense of our constitutional right to vote,” she said. “We have come too far and fought too hard to see everything systematically dismantled and restricted by those who wish to silence us.”

White House Details Plan To Fight Voter Suppression

A $25 million Democratic National Committee initiative will seek to register voters and fight voter suppression, but it underscores Democrats' challenges in their larger fight.
WASHINGTON -- Facing an onslaught of state-level ballot restrictions and gridlock in Congress over voting rights legislation, the White House detailed a multimillion-dollar plan on Thursday to register voters and fight voter suppression. 
  In a speech at Howard University, Vice President Kamala Harris said the Democratic National Committee would invest $25 million in voter outreach and litigation.
  ''It is never too early to defend your rights,'' Ms. Harris said, hours before she and President Biden met with civil rights organizations to discuss voting rights and a police overhaul at the White House.
  The White House has sought to show progress on the issue even without legislation, after Republicans recently blocked the most ambitious voting rights bill to come before Congress in a generation. But the investment also underscores the dwindling chance the Biden administration and its allies have to pass sweeping legal changes expanding voting rights, and the tremendous challenge they face in battling a wave of state Republican voting laws.
  Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said that while the engagement by the White House was encouraging, ''there is no substitute for federal legislative action.''
  ''The Democrats are going to have to face that fact,'' Mr. Waldman said. ''Bottom line is, as hard as it is, as many obstacles as there are, there is no alternative to strong legislative action if we want to save voting rights in America.''
  Ms. Harris, who was tapped this year to lead the administration's efforts on voting rights, did not shy away from describing the daunting test the administration is facing. Nearly 400 bills that would restrict voting are moving forward in nearly 50 states, according to a tracker maintained by the Brennan Center for Justice -- a point Ms. Harris emphasized to the crowd at Howard.
  ''This is designed, I believe, to make it harder for you to vote, so that you don't vote,'' Ms. Harris said.
  Democrats have suffered recent defeats on the issue in the courts as well as in Congress.
  Voting rights activists face an uphill road to fight laws passed by Republican-controlled legislatures that make it harder for people of color to vote after the Supreme Court upheld voting restrictions in Arizona this month. In a 6-to-3 decision, the court ruled that such legal challenges would need to prove substantial and disproportionate burdens on minority voters, a standard that suggests that courts will be unlikely to overturn many of the measures state Republicans are enacting.
  That decision came days after Senate Republicans blocked the For the People Act, leaving Democrats without a clear path forward.
  The legislation would have ushered in the largest federally mandated expansion of voting rights since the 1960s, ended the practice of partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts and created a new public campaign financing system. It also prompted contention among some Democrats, who privately discussed moving forward with a narrower bill to quickly provide protection for voters. Republicans had never seriously considered the larger bill, portraying it as a self-serving federalization of elections to benefit Democrats.
  The Democrats' best remaining hope to pass a bill would come from eliminating the filibuster, the 60-vote supermajority requirement in the Senate that Republicans used to block the legislation. Progressives have promised to ramp up pressure on a handful of moderate Democrats opposed to eliminating the legislative rule. But those senators -- led by Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- appear unlikely to budge.
  ''Our point of view is we're facing a state of emergency,'' said Marc H. Morial, the president and chief executive of the National Urban League, one of the community-based organizations that was represented at the White House meeting on Thursday.
  Mr. Morial said activists discussed the restrictions passed by Republican state legislatures, as well as voting changes that could win the support of Mr. Manchin. They also voiced strong opposition to a national voter identification law.
  ''We suggest the full weight, prestige, power of the bully pulpit of the presidency be behind this fight for democracy,'' Mr. Morial said.
  In the meantime, the Biden administration has turned to the Justice Department, which filed a lawsuit last month over a sweeping voting law passed by a Republican-led legislature in Georgia.
  The money from the Democratic National Committee announced on Thursday continued the push, Ms. Harris said. The $25 million investment is in addition to $20 million that Jaime R. Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, pledged would be spent before the 2022 midterm elections.
  ''We all know this is nothing new,'' Mr. Harrison said on Thursday. ''It's the ghost of Jim Crow.''
  In her speech to Howard, Ms. Harris underlined the value of voting. ''Our democracy is strongest when everyone participates,'' she said. ''Our democracy as a nation is weaker when people are left out. So this is the fight, this is the fight of our lifetime.''

The decision, a test of what remains of the Voting Rights Act, suggests that challenges to many new measures making it harder to vote may not be successful.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Thursday gave states new latitude to impose restrictions on voting, using a ruling in a case from Arizona to signal that challenges to laws being passed by Republican legislatures that make it harder for minority groups to vote would face a hostile reception from a majority of the justices. 
  The vote was 6 to 3, with the court's three liberal members in dissent.
  The decision was among the most consequential in decades on voting rights, and it was the first time the court had considered how a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 applies to restrictions that have a particular impact on people of color.
  The six conservative justices in the majority concluded that the relevant part of the act can be used to strike down voting restrictions only when they impose substantial and disproportionate burdens on minority voters, effectively blocking their ability to cast a ballot -- a standard suggesting that the Supreme Court would not be inclined to overturn many of the measures Republicans have pursued or approved around the country.
  ''Where a state provides multiple ways to vote,'' Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority, ''any burden imposed on voters who choose one of the available options cannot be evaluated without also taking into account the other available means.''
  In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the majority had done violence to the Voting Rights Act, a civil rights landmark.
  ''Wherever it can, the majority gives a cramped reading to broad language,'' she wrote. ''And then it uses that reading to uphold two election laws from Arizona that discriminate against minority voters.''
  Justice Kagan said the court's action was a devastating blow to the nation's ideals.
  ''What is tragic here,'' she wrote, ''is that the court has (yet again) rewritten -- in order to weaken -- a statute that stands as a monument to America's greatness and protects against its basest impulses. What is tragic is that the court has damaged a statute designed to bring about 'the end of discrimination in voting.'''
  The ruling came at a time when disputes over voting have taken center stage in American politics, and it will draw new attention to congressional efforts to address new state voting restrictions.
  An ambitious, sprawling bill being pushed by Democrats, called the For the People Act, is stalled in the evenly divided Senate. Unless moderate Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia change their minds and agree to change Senate filibuster rules to allow legislation to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes necessary for most bills, it has little chance of becoming law.
  Some congressional Democrats hold out hope for narrower legislation, notably the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court eight years ago. Still, there is little sign of sufficient Republican support to get that measure through the Senate.
  The court's decision may also complicate the Justice Department's suit against a new Georgia voting law. 
  ''The court today also makes it harder to prove intentional racial discrimination in passing a voting rule, making it that much harder for D.O.J. to win in its suit against the new Georgia voting law,'' Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in a blog post.
  The larger message of the ruling was that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, hobbled after the Supreme Court in 2013 effectively struck down its central provision, retains only limited power to combat voting restrictions said to disproportionately affect minority voters' access to the polls.
  The 2013 decision, Shelby County v. Holder, concerned the law's Section 5, which required prior federal approval of changes to voting procedures in parts of the country with a history of racial and other discrimination. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s majority opinion in that case said the law's Section 2 would remain in place to protect voting rights by allowing litigation after the fact.
  While Section 5 was available, Section 2 was used mostly in redistricting cases, where the question was whether voting maps had unlawfully diluted the voting power of minority groups. Its role in testing restrictions on the denial of the right to vote itself has been subject to much less attention.
  President Biden said in a statement that ''the court has now done severe damage'' to those two important provisions of the Voting Rights Act.
  ''After all we have been through to deliver the promise of this nation to all Americans, we should be fully enforcing voting rights laws, not weakening them,'' he said. 
  ''While this broad assault against voting rights is sadly not unprecedented, it is taking on new forms,'' Mr. Biden said. ''It is no longer just about a fight over who gets to vote and making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It is about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all.''
  In his majority opinion, Justice Alito wrote that states had a legitimate interest in rooting out fraud.
  ''Fraud can affect the outcome of a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight,'' he wrote. ''Fraud can also undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.''
  Justice Alito wrote that the court was not announcing an ironclad standard for lower courts to apply in cases challenging voting restrictions. ''As this is our first foray into the area,'' he wrote, ''we think it sufficient for present purposes to identify certain guideposts that lead us to our decision in these cases.''
  Justice Alito sketched out five guideposts.
  First, he wrote, the burden imposed by the challenged restriction must be substantial. ''Voting takes time and, for almost everyone, some travel, even if only to a nearby mailbox,'' he wrote. ''Mere inconvenience cannot be enough.''
  Second, he wrote, courts should consider ''the degree to which a challenged rule has a long pedigree or is in widespread use in the United States.''
  Third, ''the size of any disparities in a rule's impact on members of different racial or ethnic groups is also an important factor,'' Justice Alito wrote, adding that courts may discount disparities ''to the extent that minority and nonminority groups differ with respect to employment, wealth and education.''
  Fourth, courts must consider all of the ways voters can cast ballots.
  Fifth, he wrote, courts should consider the state's reason for the restriction. ''One strong and entirely legitimate state interest,'' he wrote, ''is the prevention of fraud.''
  Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined the majority opinion.
  Justice Kagan said the majority's list of guideposts amounted to a recipe for voter suppression.
  ''The list -- not a test, the majority hastens to assure us, with delusions of modesty -- stacks the deck against minority citizens' voting rights,'' she wrote. ''Never mind that Congress drafted a statute to protect those rights -- to prohibit any number of schemes the majority's non-test test makes it possible to save.''
  Two restrictions were at issue in the case, Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, No. 19-1257. One required election officials to discard ballots cast at the wrong precinct. The other made it a crime for campaign workers, community activists and most other people to collect ballots for delivery to polling places, a practice that critics call ''ballot harvesting.'' The law made exceptions for family members, caregivers and election officials.
  Both restrictions were lawful under the court's new guideposts, Justice Alito wrote.
  The ban on out-of-precinct voting was justified, he wrote, because the burden of finding the correct polling place is minor; there are other ways to vote, including by mail; and the number of discarded ballots was small.
  Justice Kagan saw things differently.
  ''Arizona is the national outlier in dealing with out-of-precinct votes, with the next-worst offender nowhere in sight,'' she wrote. ''In 2012, about 35,000 ballots across the country were thrown out because they were cast at the wrong precinct. Nearly one in three of those discarded votes -- 10,979 -- was cast in Arizona.''
  ''Elections are often fought and won at the margins -- certainly in Arizona,'' Justice Kagan wrote, noting that Mr. Biden defeated President Donald J. Trump by only 10,457 votes in Arizona last year.
  Justice Alito also sustained the prohibitions on ballot collections under the new guideposts, saying that they imposed a minor burden, left open other ways of voting and were meant to combat fraud.
  Justice Kagan responded that the measure disproportionately affected rural Native American communities that lacked ready access to mail service. Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined Justice Kagan's dissent.
  The larger battle in the case was not whether the particular challenged restrictions should survive. The Biden administration, for instance, told the justices in an unusual letter that the Arizona measures did not violate Section 2. But the letter disavowed the Trump administration's interpretation of Section 2, which would have limited its availability to test the lawfulness of all sorts of voting restrictions.
  Justice Kagan wrote that the court's decision might affect many new laws.
  ''In recent months, state after state has taken up or enacted legislation erecting new barriers to voting,'' she wrote. ''Those laws shorten the time polls are open, both on Election Day and before. They impose new prerequisites to voting by mail and shorten the windows to apply for and return mail ballots. They make it harder to register to vote and easier to purge voters from the rolls. Two laws even ban handing out food or water to voters standing in line.''
  ''Some of those restrictions may be lawful under the Voting Rights Act,'' she wrote. ''But chances are that some have the kind of impact the act was designed to prevent -- that they make the political process less open to minority voters than to others.''

The Rest of the World Is Worried About America; Ezra Klein

Highlight: When experts from other countries look at “the oldest democracy,” they don’t like what they see. 
Body




This weekend, American skies will be aflame with fireworks celebrating our legacy of freedom and democracy, even as Republican legislature after Republican legislature constricts the franchise and national Republicans have filibustered the expansive For The People Act. It will be a strange spectacle.
It is hard to view your own country objectively. There is too much cant and myth, too many stories and rituals. So over the past week, I’ve been asking foreign scholars of democracy how the fights over the American political system look to them. These conversations have been, for the most part, grim.
“I’m positive that American democracy is not what Americans think it is,” David Altman, a political scientist in Chile, told me. “There is a cognitive dissonance between what American citizens believe their institutions are and what they actually are.”
“The thing that makes me really worried is how similar what’s going on in the U.S. looks to a series of countries in the world where democracy has really taken a big toll and, in many cases, died,” Staffan Lindberg, a Swedish political scientist who directs the Varieties of Democracy Institute, said. “I’m talking about countries like Hungary under Orban, Turkey in the early days of Erdogan’s rule, Modi in India, and I can go down the line.”
[Listen to “The Ezra Klein Show,” a podcast about ideas that matter.]
Perhaps perversely, I was cheered by Lindberg’s list. America defies those examples in a consequential, and often ignored, way. In most cases of democratic collapse, a dominant party deploys its power and popularity to tighten its control. But there is more possibility in America than that. Democrats have a slim governing majority, at least nationally, and they are not fighting for the status quo. Even Senator Joe Manchin’s compromise proposal — to ban partisan gerrymandering, pass automatic voter registration, ensure 15 days of early voting, reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act and make Election Day a holiday, to name just a few provisions — would be a striking expansion of American democracy, bigger by far than anything passed since the 1960s.
Liberal pundits like, well, me, often focus on the risk of backsliding. And that is real. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that between early January and mid-May, at least 14 states enacted 22 laws that restrict access to the vote, putting the U.S. “on track to far exceed its most recent period of significant voter suppression.” A separate report by three voting rights groups tallied up 24 laws enacted in 14 states this year that will allow state legislatures to “politicize, criminalize and interfere in election administration.”
But the reverse is also true: The Brennan Center found at least 28 bills expanding voter access were signed in 14 states. The story of this era isn’t regression, but polarization. “We are becoming a two-tiered society when it comes to voting,” Ari Berman, author of “Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America,” told me on a recent episode of my podcast, “where it’s really easy to vote in some places, namely bluer places. And it’s really hard or getting harder to vote if you live in a red state.”
One thing foreign observers see clearly is that multiethnic democracy in America is a flower rooting in thin soil. We sometimes brag that we are the world’s oldest democracy, and that is true enough in a technical sense. But if you use a more modern definition of democracy, one that includes voting rights for women and minorities as a prerequisite, then we are one of the world’s younger democracies.
“For me, as a democracy scholar, it’s ridiculous to say America is the oldest democracy in the world,” Lindberg said. “The U.S. did not become a democracy until at least after the civil rights movement in the ’60s. In that sense, it’s kind of a new democracy, like Portugal or Spain.”
This is evident in our institutions. A society that valued democracy and political participation would not design the system we have. “For instance, the Electoral College,” Altman said. “From my perspective, this is a neolithic institution. It surprises every scholar of democracy worldwide.” Or the scheduling of American elections. “Why do you vote on Tuesday?” Altman asked me. “You don’t give people space to vote. You have to ask your employer to have the time to go out and vote. It’s weird.” Then there’s the role of money. “It looks much more like a plutocratic regime of democracy,” he told me.
From this perspective, the Republican Party’s ongoing efforts to silence certain voters and politicize electoral administration are not aberrations from a glittering past of fair and competitive contests. They are reversions to our mean. And that makes them all the likelier to succeed.
“Younger democracies tend to be weaker,” Lindberg said. “It’s much more common that young democracies fail than older ones. If America became so bad that it could no longer be considered a democracy, it would be a return to America’s historical norm: Some liberal rights for some people, but not to the extent that it is a true democracy.”
This is less a fight over the idea of democracy than over who gets to participate in it, and how their participation is weighted. “This isn’t about how people are electing their government,” Ivan Krastev, a political scientist who is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies in Bulgaria, told me. “Everything is about what kind of people the government wants to elect — who you’ll give citizenship, who you’ll give the vote to, who you’ll try to exclude from voting.”
Krastev’s theory, drawing on both European and American history, is that democratic states often have two kinds of majorities. One is the historical majority of the nation-state. In Europe, those majorities tend to be ethnic. In America, it’s bound more tightly by race and religion. But then there’s the more literal definition of a democratic majority: the coalition of voters that can come together to win elections. Unlike the historical majority, the electoral majority can, and does, change every few years.
Often, those two converge. The electoral majority reflects the historical majority. But in America, they increasingly conflict. “It used to seem these majorities were in harmony, but now it’s about how much the electoral majorities can change the permanent majority,” he told me. During the Yugoslav wars, Krastev said, there was a famous saying. “Why should I be in a minority in your country when you can be a minority in mine?”
At times, this is startlingly explicit, as when Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said, “If you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.” To Krastev, though, Vos’s comment simply makes the subtext of the moment into text. “The major power of the political community is the power to include and exclude,” he said. “Who decides who you are going to exclude?”
I do not want to be blasé about the Republican Party’s assault on elections. It is a fearful thing to watch one of America’s two political parties develop the view that democracy itself is its problem, and an agenda with which to try to neuter the threat. I’ve described this as “the doom loop for democracy”: a party that wins power while losing votes will use the power it still holds to undermine the voters and the elections that threaten its future.
But that is not the only possible outcome here. It has been a cheering development to watch more and more Democrats realize that they actually need to fight for democracy. And with a simple change to the filibuster, they could pass legislation that would do more to better America’s electoral institutions than anything since the Voting Rights Act in 1965.
In that way, Republicans perceive the threat correctly: A country that is far closer to being truly democratic, where the unpopularity of their ideas would expose them to punishing electoral consequences. A country worthy of the stories we tell about it.

Democrats Are Left With a Narrower Path To Fight Voting Limits

The Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday involving Arizona voting laws appeared to limit the options for voting rights groups to mount legal challenges to restrictive new measures being passed in Republican-controlled states.
Voting rights activists, on the defensive this year in the face of a wave of restrictive new voting laws, grappled on Thursday with new guidance from the Supreme Court signaling that the challenge will be even steeper now for opposing these laws in court. 
  The 6-to-3 ruling established a series of ''guideposts'' for what could potentially constitute a violation under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, appearing to limit one of the few paths Democrats and activists have for mounting legal challenges to new measures currently being proposed and passed in Republican-controlled states.
  ''This decision overly constricts how we view evidence in our Section 2 cases, and that's going to make it harder -- not unwinnable -- but harder,'' said Allison Riggs, a senior lawyer at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the rights of people of color.
  There are other legal avenues to challenge restrictive voting laws besides the Voting Rights Act, including under the First, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. But the act has been paramount in helping to rein in laws that could disproportionately affect communities of color, and the decision could threaten some of the legal strategies that voting rights groups and election lawyers have been drafting to challenge some of the new laws.
  But voting rights experts noted that the court's decision on Thursday did not invalidate or significantly hollow out Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. ''I do think the test will work to stop a lot of discriminatory electoral practices,'' said Chad Dunn, the co-founder of the Voting Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a longtime voting rights lawyer. ''And that part is good news.''
  President Biden said he was ''deeply disappointed'' in the court's ruling and urged Congress to ''restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength.''
  At least three major cases involving Section 2 claims are in the federal court system, according to a database of election litigation maintained by Ohio State University. One of the cases is a lawsuit that the Justice Department filed last week against Georgia, arguing that the state's new omnibus voting law, S.B. 202, is racially discriminatory in both its intent and its impact.
  While the case was brought under Section 2, some election lawyers said that it was unlikely to be derailed by the court's decision on Thursday.
  ''There's two ways to prove a Section 2 case -- you can show there's purposeful discrimination, or you can show that the law at issue had a discriminatory effect,'' said Tom Perez, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former chief of the civil rights division of the Justice Department. ''The court narrowed the effects test. The purpose claims are unchanged, and the Georgia case is a purpose case. The Georgia cases that were recently filed, they include claims of intentional discrimination and they include constitutional claims.''
  Republicans said the court's ruling would serve as a green light for G.O.P. state legislators to pursue addition restrictions on voting.
  ''Rhetorically, it will provide them a shield to say, 'What we're doing is perfectly legitimate, the Supreme Court lets us do it,''' said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer. ''What's important to look at in that opinion is what the court looks at in the usual burdens of voting. You have to be halfway informed about where your polling precinct is. If a bunch of people can't figure out where their voting precinct is, that doesn't mean you have to lessen common-sense protections to help them.''
  The conservative Heritage Foundation, which along with its political arm, Heritage Action, have spent years trying to add numerous restrictions to voting, said that states should follow Arizona's lead in enacting tougher voting laws.
  Garrett Bess, the vice president of Heritage Action, called the Supreme Court's decision ''an enormous win for election integrity and voter confidence.'' He added, ''State officials across the country should take note and work to enact similar policies in their states.''
  On Capitol Hill, the ruling added more fuel to an already fiery push by Democrats to enact two voting laws that would lower barriers to the ballot and effectively prevent states from putting in place many laws that raise them. The first bill, the For the People Act, includes new federal minimum standards for voting that would neuter laws like Arizona's. The second, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would reinstate a crucial plank of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that was struck down in 2013 and that requires states with a history of discrimination to obtain approval from the Justice Department for changes to any voting laws.
  ''Congress must act where the court has failed voters across the country,'' said Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Steve Cohen of Tennessee, top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee. They said the committee would ''expeditiously complete its work on an updated John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and move to bring legislation to the House floor as quickly as possible.''
  Republicans are opposed to both of Democrats' bills, but party leaders vowed to keep trying through the summer into the fall to pass them. Progressives, in particular, took Thursday's decision as yet another data point to marshal in their fight to eliminate the legislative filibuster in the Senate to allow their party to go around Republicans and pass the bills with simple majorities.
  Since the November election, at least 22 new laws in 14 states have been enacted that impose new restrictions on voting, alarming Democrats and voting rights groups who say the measures are a threat to one of the pillars of democracy. So far, Democrats have had little recourse as states like Georgia, Florida and Iowa pass new laws, other than to file lawsuits and mount aggressive voter education campaigns.
  The two provisions of Arizona law at the core of the Supreme Court decision on Thursday were increasingly common restrictions on voting that have appeared in other states. One law banned third parties from helping voters with dropping off their absentee ballots, a process that Republicans derisively call ''ballot harvesting'' but that is designed to help older, sick or otherwise disabled voters with handling their ballot. The other law canceled all votes cast in person at the wrong precinct.
  At least 22 states have passed or introduced a law restricting ballot collections, according to a database maintained by the Voting Rights Lab, a liberal-leaning voting rights group. And one of the provisions in Georgia's law would bar any voter from being allowed to vote provisionally at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m.
  Past Supreme Court rulings on voting laws have often been followed by rushes of legislation crafted in light of the decisions. After the Court upheld an Indiana voter identification law in 2008, numerous other states, including North Carolina, Texas and Pennsylvania, sought to pass similar laws.
  Jen Jordan, a Georgia state senator who is seeking the Democratic nomination for state attorney general, said the ruling on Thursday would make it more difficult to bring legal challenges against the state's new voting law, known as S. B. 202, because it would be necessary to prove that Georgia Republicans intended to make it harder for people of color to vote, rather than that being the effect of the new law.
  ''It's very difficult to gather enough evidence or appropriate evidence to show actual intent,'' she said, ''and that seems like the only way you can do it now under the V.R.A.''
  Even as some voting rights groups noted that it was not a worst-case scenario ruling, Democrats around the country were quick to deride the decision by the Supreme Court, which broke down along the court's 6-3 ideological divide, and vowed to redouble their efforts to pass federal voting legislation.
  ''Today's Supreme Court decision reinforces what we already know: Voting rights are under assault in America and we must act with the fierce urgency of now to end the era of voter suppression once and for all,'' said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat and the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.

But voting rights experts noted that the court’s decision on Thursday did not invalidate or significantly hollow out Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “I do think the test will work to stop a lot of discriminatory electoral practices,” said Chad Dunn, the co-founder of the Voting Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a longtime voting rights lawyer. “And that part is good news.”
President Biden said he was “deeply disappointed” in the court’s ruling and urged Congress to “restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength.”
At least three major cases involving Section 2 claims are in the federal court system, according to a database of election litigation maintained by Ohio State University. One of the cases is a lawsuit that the Justice Department filed last week against Georgia, arguing that the state’s new omnibus voting law, S.B. 202, is racially discriminatory in both its intent and its impact.
While the case was brought under Section 2, some election lawyers said that it was unlikely to be derailed by the court’s decision on Thursday.
“There’s two ways to prove a Section 2 case — you can show there’s purposeful discrimination, or you can show that the law at issue had a discriminatory effect,” said Tom Perez, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former chief of the civil rights division of the Justice Department. “The court narrowed the effects test. The purpose claims are unchanged, and the Georgia case is a purpose case. The Georgia cases that were recently filed, they include claims of intentional discrimination and they include constitutional claims.”
Republicans said the court’s ruling would serve as a green light for G.O.P. state legislators to pursue addition restrictions on voting.
“Rhetorically, it will provide them a shield to say, ‘What we’re doing is perfectly legitimate, the Supreme Court lets us do it,’” said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer. “What’s important to look at in that opinion is what the court looks at in the usual burdens of voting. You have to be halfway informed about where your polling precinct is. If a bunch of people can’t figure out where their voting precinct is, that doesn’t mean you have to lessen common-sense protections to help them.”
The conservative Heritage Foundation, which along with its political arm, Heritage Action, have spent years trying to add numerous restrictions to voting, said that states should follow Arizona’s lead in enacting tougher voting laws.
Garrett Bess, the vice president of Heritage Action, called the Supreme Court’s decision “an enormous win for election integrity and voter confidence.” He added, “State officials across the country should take note and work to enact similar policies in their states.”
On Capitol Hill, the ruling added more fuel to an already fiery push by Democrats to enact two voting laws that would lower barriers to the ballot and effectively prevent states from putting in place many laws that raise them. The first bill, the For the People Act, includes new federal minimum standards for voting that would neuter laws like Arizona’s. The second, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would reinstate a crucial plank of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that was struck down in 2013 and that requires states with a history of discrimination to obtain approval from the Justice Department for changes to any voting laws.
“Congress must act where the court has failed voters across the country,” said Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Steve Cohen of Tennessee, top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee. They said the committee would “expeditiously complete its work on an updated John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and move to bring legislation to the House floor as quickly as possible.”
Republicans are opposed to both of Democrats’ bills, but party leaders vowed to keep trying through the summer into the fall to pass them. Progressives, in particular, took Thursday’s decision as yet another data point to marshal in their fight to eliminate the legislative filibuster in the Senate to allow their party to go around Republicans and pass the bills with simple majorities.
Since the November election, at least 22 new laws in 14 states have been enacted that impose new restrictions on voting, alarming Democrats and voting rights groups who say the measures are a threat to one of the pillars of democracy. So far, Democrats have had little recourse as states like Georgia, Florida and Iowa pass new laws, other than to file lawsuits and mount aggressive voter education campaigns.
The two provisions of Arizona law at the core of the Supreme Court decision on Thursday were increasingly common restrictions on voting that have appeared in other states. One law banned third parties from helping voters with dropping off their absentee ballots, a process that Republicans derisively call “ballot harvesting” but that is designed to help older, sick or otherwise disabled voters with handling their ballot. The other law canceled all votes cast in person at the wrong precinct.
At least 22 states have passed or introduced a law restricting ballot collections, according to a database maintained by the Voting Rights Lab, a liberal-leaning voting rights group. And one of the provisions in Georgia’s law would bar any voter from being allowed to vote provisionally at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m.
Past Supreme Court rulings on voting laws have often been followed by rushes of legislation crafted in light of the decisions. After the Court upheld an Indiana voter identification law in 2008, numerous other states, including North Carolina, Texas and Pennsylvania, sought to pass similar laws.
Jen Jordan, a Georgia state senator who is seeking the Democratic nomination for state attorney general, said the ruling on Thursday would make it more difficult to bring legal challenges against the state’s new voting law, known as S. B. 202, because it would be necessary to prove that Georgia Republicans intended to make it harder for people of color to vote, rather than that being the effect of the new law.
“It’s very difficult to gather enough evidence or appropriate evidence to show actual intent,” she said, “and that seems like the only way you can do it now under the V.R.A.”
Even as some voting rights groups noted that it was not a worst-case scenario ruling, Democrats around the country were quick to deride the decision by the Supreme Court, which broke down along the court’s 6-3 ideological divide, and vowed to redouble their efforts to pass federal voting legislation.
“Today’s Supreme Court decision reinforces what we already know: Voting rights are under assault in America and we must act with the fierce urgency of now to end the era of voter suppression once and for all,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat and the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.

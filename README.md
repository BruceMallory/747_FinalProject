# FinalProject
This is my final project for the course 747: Social Data Analysis, taught by Chris
Wells in the Spring of 2021.

These are the relevant files:

FinalProject.pdf
- This is the file that I handed in.  It was generated by a .docx file that lives
on my personal machine.

FinalProject.Rmd
- This is where my work is organized.  Originally I was going knit my final product
using this file.  But the sizing and spacing of my visualizations worked much
better when I generated them from this .Rmd then copy and pasted them into a 
word document.

display_functions.R
- As titled.  Functions for my visualizations

filtering_functions.R
-As titled. A script for the code I used to filter words as I looked for target
words to use in my visualizations

wrangling-functions.R
-As titled.  The functions I built to load my articles into R in tranches.

/Data
-A folder containing the downloaded .RTF files and the massaged .txt files that
were generated from the downloaded files.  This folder also contains .RData files
of the two data frames that all of my visualizations were based upon.
